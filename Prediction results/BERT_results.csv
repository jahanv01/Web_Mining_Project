"Bought these again after losing the last pair on a flight from Honduras.  I'm sure whoever found them needed them more than me to not return them to the lost and found.  I only assume they were used to silence the nagging of their wife or horrendous cries and screams from their illegitimate children...which these headphones are GREAT FOR.  When I want to silence the voices in my head, I throw these on and put on Eminem's 'Rap God' and forget who I am.  Sometimes I picture myself as a bulldog walking in the hood and can only see the female dogs (b@$!%!) bark at me but I can't hear them because I'm wearing these AWESOME HEADPHONES!!!  Or I imagine I'm an ancient samurai warrior that is wielding a razor bladed kitana running through the fields of war while dismembering and cutting through the flesh of my enemies but I can't hear their screams because I'M WEARING THESE HEADPHONES.  Life is definitely brighter and quieter since I have been reunited with these headphones. Previously named Photive, the X5 is an awesome pair of headphones.",Positive,2,2

"I have tried MANY headphones before I settled on the ANC9 , here is my story:<br />I was looking for noise cancelling headphones and I didn't care much about the sound quality compared to the noise cancelling ability, I tried many but the finalist were 1: Bose QC 25<br />  2: Audio Technica ATH-ANC7<br />  3: Audio Technica ATH-ANC9<br />Best Noise Cancelling ,  1:The Bose 10/10<br />  2:Audio Technica ATH-ANC9  9.5/10 almost as good as the Bose<br />  3:Audio Technica ATH-ANC7  8/10<br /><br />Best Sound Quality  1 : Audio Technica ATH-ANC9  9/10<br />  2 :Bose  8.5/10<br />  3 :Audio Technica ATH-ANC7  6/10 &#34;reason is when you turn NC off, it sounds like CRAP&#34;..<br /><br />Comfort  1: Audio Technica ATH-ANC9 , 9/10 nice memory foam, light weight but still hold on to your ears with comfort , &#34; I wouldn't run in these , sweat  will be an issuw because of the leather &#34;<br />  2: Bose  9/10 very comfortable but very light and feels flimsy on your head !!<br />  3: Audio Technica ATH-ANC7  6/10 I would not wear them for more then 45 minuets, they started giving me headache<br /><br />Best Value/money  1: Audio Technica ATH-ANC9, Great noise cancelling , Great audio quality , Good price , Good built quality<br />  2: Bose QC25 , Great noise cancelling , Great audio quality , High price , So So  built quality<br />  3: Audio Technica ATH-ANC7 Good noise cancelling , Good audio quality , Great price, Good built quality<br /><br />I decided on the ANC 9 because i got Great noise cancelling and audio quality for 150$ less then the Bose !!<br /><br />I have tried a couple of the cheaper ones , but to be honest the noise cancelling in anything cheaper then the ANC7 is not worth it for me,<br />I hope this helps someone",Positive,2,2

"These are a more comfortable than the original pads, which I'd been using for a few years.  But honestly, I've been loving my monoprice headphones so much that I almost felt guilty for only spending 18 dollars on them.  Dollar for dollar, that's probably the best audio purchase I've ever made.  For a few bucks more they look a little less nondescript and I can wear them for longer.",Positive,2,2

"[[VIDEOID:1c51a2380ef23901bff86e6782108a92]] The volume that comes out of this little speaker box is tremendous and I don't say the word tremendous very often but that is exactly what it is! We took this on vacation with us and it didn't take up a whole lot of space, it was the perfect way to listen to music and connect with our different devices.<br /><br />This portable speaker system is GREAT! I am very pleased with the sound and the value. The sound quality of this speaker is better than the sound quality to the Jambox but a much lower price. I highly recommend this portable tooth speaker to others, the price cant be beat. So what makes the speaker stand out from others is that this is a wireless Wi-Fi music system and not a Bluetooth system. As many of you guys may know, Wi-Fi wireless quality is much better than Bluetooth. Taking Ben to consideration there does need to be a Wi-Fi connection paired to the speaker system. But the process is quick and easy to do especially with DOSS Cloud phone applications for both the android and iPhone. Using the android app on my phone I can have multiple speakers in different parts of the house and can control them all with a single app. I think DOSS did an excellent job to be creative and make a system that stands apart from other speakers when they included a phone app as well as a wireless Wi-Fi system.<br /><br />Even though it is quite small, don't let looks fool you, this speaker puts out an amazing, loud and crystal clear sound, with thumping bass. No static or fuzz. It's very easy to pair, it will work with pretty much any device. It also comes with a USB cord.<br />I'm a music nut, can live without TV and movies, but really totally enjoy music. I have always wanted nice audio, but didn't always want to spend the money on it when other things were looming. Finally I got this to review so I am very glad I got this. It is amazing. I love music, the highs, the bass, the stereo sound, all of this. I wanted something for my desk . It has the best sound of any speaker, ever. The bass is amazing, the treble is amazing, and the whole package is amazing.<br />You'll find yourself just staring at this, listening, and wondering how this little speaker can produce such great sound. It has a great battery life,<br />If you are on the fence, go for it. You won't be disappointed. You'll only be disappointed that you didn't buy this sooner.<br /><br />With most Speakers, you have to face the speaker toward you to get the fullest sound from it. So I always find myself, changing the facing of speakers towards me. With this speaker it feels you're in a home theater system would sound coming from all directions.<br /><br />While I'm jamming out to my favorite song, if a call comes in, I don't have to turn the speaker off. The music will stop. It also has the volume and track keys as well as redial, which is very convenient. The speaker is very stylish. Both my android phone, iPhone and MacBook Pro was so easy to pair with this speaker.<br /><br />If your looking for a high quality speaker with amazing sound that's loud then this is a speaker to get.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Great value, a very competitive price<br />Quality of sound is great for a small portable speaker<br />Easy to use, simple pair without codes or extra steps<br />Excellent quality and built.

"A travel companion had one of these and I thought it would be great for my international travels.  Lugged it across the ocean and it didn't work at all.  I was told that it would convert power (120 v 220) so that I could use my US hair styling products in areas with less power, but that's just not true.  Also, it's rather heavy and bulky.  I'm sticking with the one-piece converters that are lighter, smaller and work in most countries.",Negative,1,0
Good product. It has a quality construction and the sound is quite good. That button from the remote does nothing when used with my phone (HTC One). It was supposed to answer/end calls. Later edit: microphone no longer working after 4 months. Later edit 2: The seller offered me a perfectly working replacement for my broken product. Thank you for your great support.,Positive,2,2

I'd certainly recommend buying from this vendor in the future.",Negative,0,0
"So I bought these because I saw that they have good reviews from over 22k. Here's what I think: I agree that the sound quality is good for the price, but honestly they just hurt my ears within a few minutes of using them.

"Had to return them.  They fall right off your neck if you do any physical activity.  I bought them because they are sweat resistant but you can't do anything to make you sweat while you wear them.  Also, for the price, I expected the sound to be stellar.  It was average.  I have a cheap pair and the sound is much clearer.  These do have good range, about 30 feet.  I do like the controls for taking phone calls.",Negative,2,0

"I loved this thing until it stopped working completely only a year later. No idea why, but upon skimming through some other reviews, this product's lifespan seems to be a consistent issue.

"I listened to my friends PONO player using my own Audio Technica ATH-MSR7 Hi-Res headphones, and truly it did *not* sound any better than what I've heard on my Cowon J3 player or Nexus 6 phone for that matter. I would, in fact, argue that the Cowon J3 -- with it's Jet Effect technology -- sounded noticeably better. That's probably because the claims being made by PONO -- chiefly that somehow this device and the music files that they are trying to get you to purchase (possibly re-purchase) at premium prices, will give you a sound that you will be able to discern -- is not true. This is a gimmick, with due respect and IMHO. But don't take my word for it. I think this real-wrold review of PONO by Yahoo is worth your time:<br /><br />https://www.yahoo.com/tech/it-was-one-of-kickstarters-most-successful-109496883039.html",Negative,2,0

"I was looking for a speaker that had BIG sound with out the big price. The is the one. It has great clarity, and the sound is outstanding. I bought it for camping/boating and it worked really well for both. You could actually hear it while wakeboarding (On the boat, not from the wakeboard). I bought it at the end of July and have used it on and off for hours here and there and I haven't had to charge it once. I've never seen such a great battery before. I highly recommend this product. I will likely buy this for friends come Christmas time, it's just that great!",Positive,2,2
"Absolute perfection for my need!  Audiobooks are a fav pass time and this lit'l speaker gives MEGA clear boost of sound frm my phone/mp3.  Works great w/ my laptop too.  It is small enough that I can drop in a medium sized pocket;  I position my phone/mp3 player at about the center point of my townhome and strong bluetooth connection is maintained through out.  I 1st purchased the Sharkk boombox, which is also very good, but I returned because of distortion at higher level volume.  While the Shark is more than twice the size, has a few more functions and more bass, for my personal taste the Anker sound is more pure 'n perfectly balanced -- and, at much less cost.

"Product had surprisingly good sound quality. It was advertised as water proof but the accompanying literature says to keep it away from water. Nevertheless, I love the sound quality and the portability. The range is limited to 10-15 feet.  Despite it excellent sound quality, the product is poorly made. The original purchase lasted almost a year them failed to recharge. Phillips was good about replaces, but 3 replacements failed within 90 days. The forth replacement lasted 7 months.

"I have a Bose Bluetooth speaker, but needed something to take on our river trip. I read all of the comments on this speaker and it sounded great! It was plenty loud for our group of four. My biggest complaint was the battery life. I think that the package said that the battery was supposed to last four hours... mine didn't even make it three! Also, in the description it says that it is 100% waterproof but when I got it, the tag said don't submerge in water so I didn't try!

We do trust him and he was miffed at first, but showed him reports on the website which helped him save gas by avoiding back-tracking habits. We never showed him where the unit was placed and he took a hard jump thru a mud puddle and it fell off. We looked all over for the tracker but never found it. I did buy and mount the case that has 100 pound strength magnet, but it was no match for our puddle-jumper kid.<br />  I thought it would be easy to find the lost tracker but it can be anywhere from 50-150 yards away from location pointer.",Positive,2,2

"The product did tune in QAM channels but oddly the broadcast stations were shown on odd channels.  For example, all my other QAM tuners tune in WMDT 47 ABC in DE on channel 47-1.  This one has it on channel 64-10?  None of the channels matched my other QAM tuners.  Secondly, there was no online program guide as with my other QAM tuners.  Thirdly, after programming the channels with labels, the labels would mysteriously disappear and I'd have to go back and re-label channels.  Finally, after two months, the picture would not come up anymore but the sound still did.  I tried everything, pressing the menu button, aspect button, other outputs to the TV, unplugging the device for over an hour and replugging it back in to see if it would reset.  Nothing worked and only sound comes through now.  Seems this issue was reported by others here.  I did request a refund but I don't know that I'll get one.  I will update this review to let you know.",Negative,1,0
"I am so satisfied with the quality of these earbuds! The sound quality is fantastic and is a very noticeable difference from some really cheap earbuds I was using earlier. The bass is great! I also love the design of these. They stick farther into your actual ear so they don't fall out, even during workouts. They come with extra earbud covers, just in case anything happens to yours! I thought that was a nice touch. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and honestly I am very impressed with the high quality of these earbuds.",Positive,2,2

"As something of an audio perfectionist, I could never find a bluetooth speaker that rivaled those two old living room speakers I've been dragging around since 1978.  Convenience be damned, I'd always find a way to rig those bastards up to my computer or iPhone.<br /><br />But now, I've finally found a piece of audio equipment that lets me retire those sonic anachronisms.  The Riva Turbo X delivers!  Most of the bluetooth speakers I've encountered suffer from too much high end, or too much low end, and the audio depth is always shallow.  Not so with this product.  The audio pitch is perfectly attenuated.  And there's a depth to its sound that is nothing short of mesmerizing.  Listening to a recording of the Doors in concert, I had to get up and look around the corner of the hallway because it sounded like they were actually playing in my living room.  It's that vivid!<br /><br />Anyway, the Riva Turbo X is a revelation.  Don't be a tool.  Get the Riva Turbo X now!",Positive,2,2

"These headphones are great for when I'm working out, in the subway, or when driving. The sound is super clear and the bass is amazing. Additionally the mic volume is perfect. It doesn't need to be super close to my mouth. I bought myself and my girlfriend a pair.<br /><br />Additionally, my first pair got messed up in one month, and they sent me a new one right away. The seller and the product deserve 5 stars!",Positive,2,2

"It's rare that a company comes along that stands 100 percent behind their products, even when their products are destroyed by an act of God. I had an older style DB2 that had the little control board fried by lightening. I contacted Antennas Direct about buying a new control board for my already old antenna. I had already purchased the new DB2E, but would have kept the old one as a spare. I received a message today from the company. Instead of selling or sending me a cheap control board, they are sending me a brand new DB2E antenna. That is top shelf customer service right there.",Positive,2,2
"These earbuds have some of the best noise isolation in any earbud I've had experience with. And for the price point of 26.99 on sale, I am duly impressed with the sound quality. The realwood casing of the drivers does a lot to improve the acoustics of them and really brings out the midrange tones.<br /><br />The braided cable is high quality and very nice feeling, however if you are rough on your headphones these might not be the best for you, as they aren't as robust as they could be.<br /><br />Noise isolation is fantastic and the headphones come with several different sizes of ear cup things to ensure a proper fit.<br /><br />The connector is large and grippy, which works both good and bad because it's easy to hold and to plug into any device, but it has a higher probability to snag on things as you're putting your device away.<br /><br />Overall I recommend these earbuds to anybody looking for good bang for your buck and getting an awesome sounding pair of earbuds.",Positive,2,2

"I bought two of these mounts and they are awesome. They are really beefy and should be strong enough for most if not all LCD TVs. Make no mistake, this bracket is very heavy. Most installers will need help to safely mount this unit. The weight of it makes it difficult to handle by yourself. When you see what this bracket can do and how strong it is, you will understand why it's so heavy. Trust me, you will like what this bracket can do. You will get an outstanding range of motion and adjustability with this bracket. When you pull your TV out from the wall to change the viewing angle, it stays where you put it. There's no unwanted movement or drift. The screen seems as steady as when it's back against the wall.",Positive,2,2

Great adapter from a known tech seller StatTech. Perfectly covets your laptops HDMI output to a TV with VGA and audio inputs. I bought this from other online retailer for about the same price.  (NOTE: if you want audio with your VGA output you have to use a 3.5mm male to 3.5 male audio cable to connect from the adapter to the TV/audio receiver)  Users for this adapter: Connect your newer ultrabook/laptop HDMI output to an older TV with VGA and Audio Inputs Connect your HDMI output to a newer HDTV that has no more HDMI inputs available Connect your DVD player to a monitor with no HDMI inputs (Note: you probably won't get audio on the monitor because it won't have speakers) Connect your XBOX to an old tv or monitor Extract an audio signal from your HDMI output to send audio signal to stereo or receiver Convert HDMI output to VGA than use a VGA to DVI  or RCA or SVideo adapter to connect all sorts of components.  I have used many StatTech components over the years and think they are well made and inexpensive.  Great alternative to $50 in store brands.  I recommend this adapter.,Positive,2,2

"These are excellent in-ear headphones.  When I first listened to music through these it just made me realize what crappy cheap headphones I'd been using all this time (to be fair they were in fact very cheap and have had them for a while).  But these sound great, the bass is quite good considering how tiny and inexpensive they are (I got them for less than $7) . With my old headphones, I had to turn the volume up on my phone to max to be able to hear anything but on these I actually have to turn the volume down by half and they almost eliminate or nicely muffle any outside noise since they fit snugly in the ear (it comes with 3 pairs of ear buds in different sizes).  This is just my first day using it and I was very impressed but we'll have to see how long they last. But I'd highly recommend to anyone considering buying them.",Positive,1,2
Not quite sure about it. I bought it to try and use some of my old 30pin a/v cables. Didn't seem to do anything. Thought it was junk. However it did work for charging. So maybe it just doesn't support video or I'm stupid. The latter is possible. .,Negative,1,0

Straight out of the box and plugged the clock in there was already a noticeable problem. The numbers don't show up right on the screen.

Item was defective out of the package. It would connect briefly but then the screen would go blank. Bending the cable would sometimes reconnect it briefly so I guess it had a short in it somewhere.

"AMAZING battery life!  Have been using this MP3 player almost every day (a few hours a day) for 2 nearly months and have only had to charge it twice. The only quirk is that when playing songs in the &#34;Album&#34; menu, they are always out if order. The directions mention insuring that each track begins with a number, and it should include the number of digit placeholders (ie., if there are 15 tracks, track 1 should &#34;01&#34; not a plain &#34;1&#34;).  However, this still does not work. I tried everything... even simply naming tracks &#34;01&#34;, &#34;02&#34;, &#34;03&#34;, etc., with no text at all.  HOWEVER, there is an easy work-around... Don't use &#34;Album&#34; menu, instead open the folder of the album name from the device's &#34;Folder&#34; view. All tracks will playing in order perfectly.<br /><br />That track order issue is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.  Otherwise, I can highly recommend this MP3 player.<br /><br />The seller, LinkingPort, was great.

"One of the only negatives I can find with this item is that it does not emphasize enough how much one should 'mount this on the wall or in the window'.  One review read that he just had it lying down next to his television and he picked up signals clearly, etc.  Well, I live in an apartment complex, next to other apartment complexes, down in a natural valley, so while it make work for some people it will be necessary for most others to place the antenna higher up and away from other digital devices (interference does occur).  Initially I was only receiving 15 channels, but after mounting the device and re-searching for 'air' channels the number went up to 28 channels!  Hallelujah!!!  While this certainly is not the strongest antenna available (35 mile range) I am happy with the eventual results after tinkering around and doing things the correct way.  For apartment living, in the vicinity of metropolitan areas, this works just fine.",Positive,1,2

I like the spacing of each outlet, the newer ones only have 2 spaced outlets, this has 4. The cord management is is a good idea, but it's placed too closely to the transformer spaced outlets on the end. Either the outlets have to house a regular plug, or the cord management piece has to be removed to use transformer type plugs.",Positive,2,2

These X2s I could wear all day. I was also looking for a soundstage improvement, can't say I notice a big difference from my V6s. I had always heard that an open can had better soundstage, but I can't say anything jumped out as a big improvement. As it is, I do like these headphones, and they fit and sound good to me.

I added the coax amplifier and I now get 26 channels on all 5 TVs in the house. This will only boost the coax signal to the TV's and not the overall reception from the antenna.

I ordered this so I could plug all the lights into the timer for my bearded dragon's viv.  It solves two problems for me; 1) the cords for the lights weren't long enough to reach down to the outlet and a power strip was too heavy and pulled the lights off the screen top. 2) not enough plugs on the timer.  It does its job well by giving me the extra length I need without pulling the lights down and now everything is plugged into one automatic timer.,Positive,2,2

"I purchased these record sleeves for one reason, and one reason only -- they were less expensive than the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) inner sleeves I usually order. I like the MFLS sleeves -- $20, and free two-day shipping because I'm an Amazon Prime member. But this time when I was shopping they removed the free shipping, so I searched for others and found these.<br /><br />There's not much to say other than that they seem to have the similar, but not exact, qualities as the MFSL sleeves. Perhaps a little thinner. Perhaps not. I can't tell. In some other reviews users complain about static electricity being drawn to these sleeves making them more difficult to use. I don't see it. Or feel it. Or sense it. I am a sick record nut -- I have about 10k LPs, and quite a few 45s. I always replace paper inserts with poly sleeves such as the MFSL (and these!). To make sure I don't mar an album's surface I face the opening of the inner sleeve toward the opening of the album cover, so I just have to hold the album cover and slide out the record -- and I only have to touch the label and outer edge of the record when removing it. Whether or not there is static electricity doesn't really come into play. Yes, during the winter sometimes albums do have some static charge when I place them on the turntable's platter. In those cases I use an old Zerostat gun (they do not &#34;wear out&#34;) to disperse the charge  Remember, I said I was I was a sick record nut. Those of my ilk own a Zerostat, various stylus cleaners, and often a vacuum/wet record cleaner. As I do. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.<br /><br />PS -- any old vinyl laying around gathering dust that you don't want? Bringing them to a brick and mortar record store is a waste of time, they'll just give you pennies on the dollar for your records. I, in turn, will give them a loving home where they will be cherished and LISTENED TO. Box them up. I'll pay postage. PM (private message) me! ;) .",Positive,2,2

"Prelude:<br /><br />I would consider myself an intermediate audiophile who does not want to spend megabucks on brand name products.  I seem to purchase new bluetooth speakers every several weeks  because I am not totally impressed with the ones I purchased.  Including the Sharkk 2o, I own 6 bluetooth speakers.  My favorite bluetooth speakers are the HDMX Jam Party and Ecogear Ecorox.  Both are rugged (not waterproof) with great bass.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Along comes the Sharkk 2o.  I purchased mine based on JJCEO's excellent review.  This speaker has the same weight as the HDMX Jam Party and has a slightly better bass than both the Jam Party and Ecorox.Others have posted what comes in the package so I won't.<br /><br />I have listened to the Beats Pill in stores and in my opinion, the Sharkk 2o sounds better in bass and clarity.  I cranked up the volume to maximum and no vibrations or distortions. I inserted a microSD card, switched to that mode and my music started without a hitch.  I was able to changed songs using the buttons on top of the speakers.  The is a plus in case you do not have a music device with you but still want to listen to tunes.<br /><br />This speaker is sharp looking with both silver trim and gray rubberized cover.  Both the front and rear grilles blend nicely with the rest of the speaker.  Both the look and solid feel of this speaker boasts quality.<br /><br />Bottom line:  you will not be disappointed with purchasing the Skarkk 2o waterproof bluetooth speaker",Positive,2,2

"nI thought it would be neat to have a bedside clock that could also charge our phones, but the clock is so very cheapie in feel and function that if I'd paid for it I'd send it back (I received it for free). It's super lightweight & so a little tippy, the controls are really basic - the kind you have to hold down the button to set the time while the clock moves forward minute by minute, which is especially aggrivating if it's evening as you have to scroll through all the a.m. times to get to the p.m. (meaning it doesn't even have a direct way to set a.m. or p.m.), and lastly, for me, the clock is waaaay too bright with no way to dim it.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to my daughter for her room & even she doesn't want it (she's 10). The light is so bright that you have to have the clock turned away from the bed - what good is that? I suppose you could have it far away from the bed, but then it's not very handy for charging your phone or as a bedside alarm, is it?<br /><br />In my opinion this is a really super cheapie clock just in a kinda neat shaped plastic container. I'd recommend you look for something else - I will be. I think we'll just get another of the oregon scientific clocks that shine the time on the ceiling - so far I've found those to be the best ones.",Negative,1,0

"The good thing about this cart is the base of this cart is the only thing about this that feels solid and the wheels roll smoothly. The bad things are that the shelf feels flimsy and I don't think it could hold a heavier laptop. The TV doesn't feel like it is secure on the mount that connects to the cart. If you touch it, it moves around easily so you have to be very careful when moving it. When I sent an e-mail to the seller about the issue with the shelf, they sent an e-mail with a picture of a page out of the assembly instructions that I already had and told me to follow those instructions in that page. Suffice it to say, I'm not a very big fan of this cart but I'll be holding onto it because I don't want to have to disassemble it and send it back.",Negative,1,0

"One this I love about this pair of headphones is the fact that the bass is improved/boosted but not over the top. You get that elevated bass that is very nice to listen to while working out, minus the headache that you can possibly get if the &#34;bass part&#34; of a device is not executed properly. It is also very light weight and comes in a handy pouch which is perfect for keeping it safe and in one place, when it's not being used. This pair of headphones are well made and very affordable.

It's good for laying by the pool or having it on table next to lounge chairs. If I walk away from it you cannot really hear it well.  This is an inexpensive 4&#34; speaker so the sound is not for audiophiles.  It is decent though for hanging by the pool.  Pros: size, splash resistant, good for close-up use, has phone capabilities, long lasting battery charge, feels solid enough if I drop it it won't cause any problems.  Cons:  buttons are hard to use as they each have multiple functions. Many times I want to increase volume and end up changing songs.  I now only use my iPhone to control volume and songs.

Edit- I finally tried this is the pool, doesn't work great, it's hard to hear & water gets in it. But the bad part is that now it won't charge or work probably. This is the third time this scenario has played out so I'm pretty sure that taking it in the pool is the problem.

"I am so pleased I purchased this sound base.  After extensive research in the area of sound bars/bases for large format LCD televisions, I settled on the ZVOX 670.  I had went to Best Buy to purchase a sound bar for my television and after a suggestion from the employee in the Magnolia Theater section of my local Best Buy, I bought the ZVOX.  This sound base is INCREDIBLE.  I have previously had a full 5.1 surround sound system and the Bose two speaker DVD system.  While both of those were both very good, the ZVOX is far beyond those!  I can't believe the quality of sound that comes from this sound base.  It is UNREAL!  For a single speaker system, it fills the entire room with LOUD, clear sound!  I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this sound base.  The three built in sub woofers are also very good.  I went from a stand alone sub woofer to the included woofers in the ZVOX.  The ZVOX subs are better!  They produce a much more pronounced and noticable bass sound on movies and TV shows alike.  I can't say enough good things about this ZVOX sound base.  It is without a doubt one of the best sound bases/bars on the market today.  Stop by a local retailer and listen to a ZVOX sound base and I assure you if you are in the market for a sound bar/base, YOU WILL want the ZVOX over what else in available out there.  Other manufacturers should take note from ZVOX on how they make their sound bars and bases.  ZVOX offers a size for any size television.",Positive,2,2

"this little boom box is just that it has so much bass for something so tiny. the function of it is seamless from the Bluetooth mode when you first turn it on then switching to micro sd card mode which is awesome my card holds about 2000 songs not that I have that many yet but its an awesome idea to store a library of music at your finger tips. It's very durable design with a rubberized exterior to resist shock from an impact. I assume it's somewhat waterproof , haven't tested that and won't if I can help it. I honestly don't have anything to say negative about this wonderful little box of awesomeness. Perhaps an FM radio , but honestly who listens to the radio any longer.

"Based on the competition, this speaker should sell for no more than $39 tops.  What you get for close to $100 is a lightweight (in more ways than one) portable.<br />The pros:<br />- lightweight<br />- rugged and waterproof<br />The cons:<br />- Very 'tinny' high end, very limited midrange, almost no bass<br />- Unbelievably annoying feature (someone thought this was a good idea???) where the unit &#34;welcomes&#34; you at sign on, and tells you to &#34;Enjoy!!&#34; -- a shrill woman's voice -- very loud (!);  then says a bunch of stuff and &#34;goodbye!&#34; when signing off.  The volume of these messages is not adjustable and is incredibly loud, regardless of your volume setting.  Even if this were a very good speaker, this would be a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />I returned this immediately, and got the Sony SRS x-3 which is amazing -- it has now been updated to the x-33 which is marginally better (slightly smaller, and slightly improved sound.).  If you can find the x-3 on close-out, I'd recommend that;  if not, the x-33 (which is on available on sale for about the same price as this terrible speaker).",Negative,2,0

"I haven't installed any yet, but they are panel mount DC plug in jacks, for any device with a 2.1mm x 5mm female plug. Rather than a nut behind the panel (not always doable or practical) these have molded-in retainer clips or &#34;ears&#34; that grab the sheet metal or material inside and hold the jack in place. It enables you to drill a hole, pull the wires through it, solder them in place and then install it all from outside the panel. I did that once just to test it out in the aluminum my trailer is made from, and it will do a satisfactory job. Initially I bought both 2.1 and 2.5 mm DC jacks, the most common types used here in the US for 12V things. This seller shipped the wrong type of one of them, but when I emailed them, they contacted me right away, and then sent me the right ones, from China at no extra cost. I like that personal touch and will be buying from this seller again-- they have a very wide range of electrical and electronic hardware at  almost unbelievable prices!",Positive,2,2

"I dont know what the other people who reviewed this product were talking about - theyre obviously not talking about the same product AT ALL.  I've heard of KEF from friends of mine and my son just left for college so I decided to make his room into a home theater (my wife wanted a &#34;home office&#34;... BAHAHAHAHA....).  Its a pretty good sized room and this 5.1 system not only fills the room with KILLER sound but it looks so cool.  My wife actually likes it. I dont think the pictures attached to the listing do them justice at all.<br /><br />These speakers feel REALLY heavy and you can tell theyre packed with technology. I read a lot about their UniQ speaker driver inside of these and its amazing. Hoonestly I am just so completely amazed at how clear and powerful this system sounds. I cannot wait for football season... Got myself a 65&#34; TV and a new Yamaha receiver, plus these E305 speakers... Its going to be great.  The subwoofer is actually also insane!  I thought it would be weird because there isnt really good pics of it so i twas hard to tell what it was going to be like but its a down-firing sub. POUNDS the floor with intense quick bass.

"If your device uses alkaline batteries, and won't tolerate the lower voltage of NiMh rechargeable batteries, rechargeable Nickel-Zinc (NiZn) batteries may be your only choice.  NiZn have a much higher voltage than NiMh -- up to 1.8 volts (vs 1.5v for alkaline and 1.2v for NiMh).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the technology still has some problems, and isn't yet mature.  Batteries may lose capacity quickly, and tend to self-discharge at higher and higher rates with each charge-cycle.<br /><br />I bought these, because they are rated at 1150mWh, which is higher than the more typical 1000mWh rating.  So I hoped these would be worth their higher-than-normal price.  However, these batteries are even worse than the typical NiZn batteries on the market today.  Of the four batteries, one was completely dead-on-arrival; and two others won't hold a full charge, after just one use.<br /><br />Only ONE of the four batteries managed to limp though two charge cycles, with enough capacity to even consider continuing to use it!  That's $5 per battery-use, which makes alkaline batteries seem like a good investment!<br /><br />Obviously, I won't be buying these batteries again.  I'm sticking with the lower-capacity 1,000 mWh versions.",Negative,0,0

"[[VIDEOID:36cb8f168cf666f0f37d28296599131a]]When compared head-to-head with the Turcom HR-903, I have to say the Voombox Party does come out the subjectively lesser... but not necessarily in terms of what you are looking for - far smaller sizing being the biggest positive for the Voombox.<br /><br />Turcom's HR-903 has a stated IP waterproofing rating of 5 (Water jets from all angles) - and I can attest to it's durability as it has been sitting on my pool deck for the past months.<br /><br />The Voombox doesn't have any IP rating I can find either on the box, the manual, or online - other than \\""Water Resistant\\"".  Without knowing what kind of internal proofing it has, I would say IPx4 (typical shower speaker level, spray and splashes) based off the grill and the cover flap on the side.<br /><br />The HR-903 is about 2 and 1/2 times the mass of the Voombox and certainly heavier, and that very well may be a big point for you.  Yet, I do frown at the complete lack of any kind of carrying case or such for the Voombox.  At this price range, I would expect some sort of case or bag.  Or for the HR-903's, an in-built handle.<br /><br />The controls on the HR-903 are touch sensitive, and can be a problem if water collects inside the little divots.  The controls on the Voombox are push buttons under a rugged silicone band - and uses the \\""+\\"",\\""-\\"" for both Volume and Track (Short Press Volume), whereas it is all separated on the HR-903.<br /><br />Now for the meat-and-potatoes, audio.<br /><br />The Voombox certainly holds its own, the 20W volume being pretty much the same level as the 30W put out by the HR-903.  Mellow yet clear spectrum with a balance between punchy and rumbly bass response.  However, the HR-903 has a more rumbly, more expansive bass response.  So it boils down to how much overdriven bass rumble you like.  I do like a gritty BEWM.  :)<br /><br />One thing to note about the Voombox, be sure the back or top isn't up against anything - the bass it pushes out will cause rattling buzz within the casing.  Also, I found the AUX In to be somewhat disappointing.  The volume basically halved, though still sounded great, and will not work with a 4 pole jack (i.e. \\""wired\\"" microphone input), just a standard 3 pole.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.e AUX In to be somewhat disappointing.

"I had to get a one of these for my boss. For non tech people, it can sometimes be confusing which cables you need to do the things you want.

When you buy something for your boss, you make sure it's one that works.<br /><br />The cable length is great so I actually didn't need an additional HDMI cable extension to use this.<br />I tested this with an HD video from my Macbook Pro on a 4k Vizio TV and it worked flawlessly.<br />No fuzzy lines, no glitchyness, or spots. The audio also works flawlessly.<br /><br />I love the white cable as well as it stands out with all the other black cables. Quick to find and quick to plug in.<br />Great product.

"This excellent BT portable speaker is the perfect 'Tweener'.  There are many sizes of portable BT speakers for almost every use, and you must compromise between sound volume and size.  For trips that require air travel I carry either the UE miniboom or the Jabra Solemate mini.  Both very light with decent, but limited, sound which is fine for hotel rooms.  For larger portable speakers to use around the house with great sound, but limited mobility, there are many good choices (I prefer the Sony SRS X88).<br />The gap that this little gem fills is the 'throw it in the picnic basket to use outdoors or at the beach'.  The sound is full and large enough to provide sufficient sound in an outdoor environment while maintaining good portability and great battery life.  I use this in the back yard to listen to my music without disturbing the neighbors and take it when we drive to Grandma's house (Grandma is still using a scratchy old record player....).<br />Surprisingly great sound, solid construction, and very good battery life.

"I'll be the first one to say I'm not a big fan of Monster Cables. It's my opinion that they produce overpriced garbage most of the time, and it's for that very reason I prefer to roll my own cables for studio use (because I know exactly what type of wire, connectors, and solder was used, as well as the time, energy, and workmanship that went into their production). That said, I bought this &#34;power conditioner&#34; long before I found out about Monster's dubious cable manufacturing and pricing methods, and it's lasted me around a decade (10 years) with zero problems until just recently when I've begun to notice a high pitch sound coming from it in the 18000hz-20000hz range. At first I thought it may have been the ballast on my DLP TV (which is also 6 or 7 years old), but I managed to track it down to the power conditioner itself.<br />The only issues I have with this power conditioner are that I have an older model without the LED load indicator on it (like the version in this listing), I have absolutely no idea what the noise suppression rating (in dB) is for this unit, nor do I know what type of waveform it actually outputs (a true/pure sine wave, a simulated/modified square wave [aka: pulse width modulated / PWM], or a basic square wave).<br />Based on the price I paid a decade ago ($150) my guess is it uses a modified square wave (PWM) at best. It is extremely unlikely that it outputs a pure sine wave, as power conditioners which output a pure sine wave tend to be very expensive, costing between several hundred and several thousand US dollars (depending on the number of outlets and features they have).<br />I do know that this conditioner has fairly good isolation for typical home theater use, though I would never trust it with anything you can not afford to replace (as it is only a &#34;mid-tier&#34; CONSUMER level product).<br /><br />If you are running expensive audio equipment within a studio environment, or you have an extremely high end home theater which includes a TV, Display, or Projector which is valued in excess of $4000, or have a receiver (or component system) valued in excess of $2000, you should be looking into PROFESSIONAL or INDUSTRIAL grade power solutions from name brand companies like Tripplite, Furman, APC, etc.<br />High end units from the above named manufacturers can be far more expensive (the Furman P-2400 IT runs $2400 last I checked) but such a solution is what you truly require if you are trying to protect tens of thousands or even millions of dollars in equipment, such as in Studio, AV, IT, Industrial, or High End Home Theater environments.<br /><br />For those of us with a &#60;$2000 TV, &#60;$500 receiver, and a few &#60;$200 book-end speakers, this unit from monster does an adequate job however, and the unit I've had has definitely held up well over time.<br />In fact I suspect the reason that mine has recently begun to make a noise is due to circuit degradation, which happens with all power conditioners given enough time. The components within them simply wear out over time, since they are constantly under load 24/7/365.<br />In my case I believe one or more capacitors are beginning to fail. Whenever electronics (with no moving parts) give off a high pitch tone it's usually due to a crappy capacitor.or Projector which is valued in excess of $4000, or have a receiver (or component system) valued in excess of $2000, you should be looking into PROFESSIONAL or INDUSTRIAL grade power solutions from name brand companies like Tripplite, Furman, APC, etc.  High end units from the above named manufacturers can be far more expensive (the Furman P-2400 IT runs $2400 last I checked) but such a solution is what you truly require if you are trying to protect tens of thousands or even millions of dollars in equipment, such as in Studio, AV, IT, Industrial, or High End Home Theater environments.

These headphones come with 3 sizes of tips and the small works very well for me.

"The last and only Walkman I owned was back in the mid-80s. That was a cassette tape player with headphones. Things have surely come a long way!<br /><br />I was drawn to this because of its hi-res quality. So far I've not been disappointed on that score. The sound is excellent, probably better than my other equipment can reflect. The unit is light but not flimsy--extremely portable. While a touch screen would have been nice, things are easily navigable, much after the fashion of a digital camera. I'm a Mac user, and while some Mackies have complained that they can't export to this device from iTunes, I don't find that to be a hindrance. Unlike the iPod, the Walkman shows up on your desktop as an external disk. You can double click on the Music folder on the device, and simply drag files from your iTunes music folder without the mediation of iTunes itself. The Walkman's software makes good sense and organization out of the iTunes folders. In short, you can bypass iTunes altogether. While some may not like this, I find it gives me better control in loading just what I want onto the device. Using the Walkman disk this way, you can even rename folders and files on your Walkman when it is connected to your computer. I'm not even going to bother with the special Mac software for loading music files.<br /><br />What else? No issues with Bluetooth connection. High-quality sound. Ample storage for such a portable device--although I'll be glad when I can fit my whole AIFF music library on a tiny player. Much as I've enjoyed my iPods in the past, I think this is better for those interested in one thing: listening to their music in high-quality format.",Positive,2,2

"This is an excellent alarm clock, with all the bells and whistles you could ask for.  The projector arm can swivel so you can aim your projection anywhere you want, and even flip directions depending on what you need.  The buttons are clear and easy to use.  The alarm has weekday/weekend options, so you don't have to remember to change your alarm or get awoken early on a sleep-in day, and there's the temperature, and I like the auto-set as well.

"i got this to record and learn old beatles songs for a solo act i am putting together. they are not available for download. it has an 1/8 aux input so you can run that line from a pad out the earphones and get a direct signal. you will need to convert the stereo signal in with a barrel adapter to convert the stereo signal to mono though if you use the aux input. see radio shack for help. it records perfectly and plays great too. only thing i don't like is that you cannot monitor the sound going in. usually you could hear it out of the unit speaker or at least through the earphone jack on the unit, but sadly neither works for this. aside from that i give it 5 stars. thank you jensen. you solved my problem for a reasonable price and i appreciate it.",Positive,2,2

"Thing does what I need which was to provide a cheap &#34;amp&#34; to power some pong table speakers and be cheap/easy to replace if it bites the bullet (or drowns in beer). It was a good price, and has the line out/line in that I wanted to have (as opposed to the famous other Lepai amp), and four speaker outputs (2 sets in stereo). It is obviously no where close to 25Wx4, but it works. The amp does give off a weird squeal when shutting off through the speakers, and sometimes the music I have playing will briefly play and then die after it's shut off. This would keep me from ever using it to try and power any speakers I care about, so I am not sure how well this thing could sound. The USB slot doesn't seem to charge devices though, which I was hoping would be a cool bonus.",Neutral,2,1

"This is my system-hifiman he500 connected to a schitt lyr amp, connected to the meridian director, sourced from a Sony sacd player and an iPhone 5 connected through an apple cck kit run through a powered USB. Messy I know, but it works great.  So how does it sound absolutely sublime, I've ran it with and without the meridian and the difference is night and day. The thwack of the beginning of Fleetwood Macs Dreams is palpable. There is a smoothness in voice of James Taylor and Eva Cassidy, that wasn't there before.  Dynamics was extraordinary, listening to the Great Fantasy Adventure album track 5, the T Rex track brought shivers to my spine. It was genuinely frightening. The moving of the brush and the incoming footstep which I've never noticed before gave it a visceral thrill. I'm sure this had a lot to do with the headphones and amp, but the director brought out the subtle nuances of the track which I've never heard before.  Don't get me wrong, the most important equipment will be the headphones, then the amp. However the meridian is just icing on the cake. You might not need it but it would be like getting a sundae without the whipped cream. Highly recommended.",Positive,2,2

"25 mile silver/black version.<br /><br />Cannot stress this enough - kinks in the cabling will be more detrimental to signal than will antenna placement.<br /><br />I'm in pretty much downtown/west Houston, and the towers are 13 miles just about due south of me.<br />The windows range between 6 and 12 feet from my TV, and go up to 9 feet above ground.<br />If I stick the antenna anywhere in the window, the cabling is kinked up (comes that way from the box), and I get ~50 channels, most of which are gibberish, and I do *not* get CBS or ABC.<br /><br />If I stretch the cabling across my living room and place it in the kitchen - yes, the kitchen - further from the window, surrounded by walls (townhome complex), with what should be infinitely greater obstructions, I get ~90 channels, and CBS/ABC reappear.<br /><br />Product deficiency? Not sure. But it's certainly cheap cabling if kinks cause this much effect. Of note, the cabling is *not* the same thickness as traditional coaxial cable you might find elsewhere in your house. Trouble is, it comes pre-packaged with kinks in it.<br /><br />I should not have issues picking up signal from 13 miles away with minimal obstruction downtown in the 4th largest city in the US.<br /><br />I *can* make it work, if I want to clothesline any visitors coming in through my front door.

"The set-up problem:<br />I purchased the Nuforce MCP-18 to solve a very specific problem I had with my set up. I wanted to be able to use the balanced stereo outputs and the 7.1 surround outputs from my BDP-105D Blu-ray into a single set of power amps. Part of the issue I have is my front L/R speakers are Goldenear Triton 2 which have a built in sub, including amp and crossover. The Goldenear speakers will accept full range signals over the standard 5 way binding posts (low frequencies are crossed over internally and directed to the sub section) or they can accept an LFE signal direct to the sub section. I wanted to be able to direct a full range signal when listening to stereo music (using the Oppo as a source) to the speakers, whereas when listening to a 7.1 (or in my case 5.1) surround signal I wanted the output to the front L/R outputs to be rolled off and use the .1 RCA output to provide the bass to the speakers. This allowed me to get the full fidelity of the stereo music signal as well as allowing me to tune the bass output when watching a movie. As a final bonus, the pre-amp allowed me to connect a fully balanced signal path from the Oppo to the balanced mono block amplifiers powering the front channels.<br /><br />The resultant solution:<br />While originally looking for the Nuforce pre-amp to give me some functionality to basically make my life a bit simpler, I actually ended up with a very good component that provides a really good level of functionality with seemingly very good quality components. Just for the volume control function alone the Nuforce is a worthwhile investment to pair with the Oppo. The only other components I have seen that will provide the functionality I am looking for without doing massive amounts of processing to the signals, are high end home theater pre-pro's that retail in the thousands. I think the key for me is the Nuforce does everything I need it to, without doing anything I don't need it to, and that is difficult to find ina world of single box home theater solutions.<br /><br />Overall I have been living with the Nuforce for around 6 months now and don't think there is a better solution for my scenario. Some of the functionality is a bit clunky (it can take a long time to ramp the volume up and down via the remote) but in general I don't think there is anything in the price range that can come close to the same solution. Unfortunately it looks like the product has been discontinued, I'm just glad I got one while they were available.",Positive,2,2

"I recieved two of these antennas. The first one does a fair job of channel reception. I have a couple of another brand and these are equivalent to those at a reduced price. Now for the criticism. Of the two that I recieved, only one was usable. One installed easily on my television, on the second one they neglected to thread the connect and therefore it will not install on a tv so it is worthless to me or anyone else. Given the low price, I expect that I will throw it away rather than both with attempting to return half of an order.",Neutral,0,1

"I admit I'm somewhat of a headphone/earbud &#34;junkie,&#34; so when I hear something priced reasonably with superb sound throughout,, I get excited.  I have several &#34;earbuds&#34; by these other brand-name manufacturers.  From my listening experience, these deserve the title of &#34;ear headphones,&#34; as they sound close to several name brand earphones that would sound the same yet cost much more.  These sound natural, and give you a rich, deep-sounding, resonant bass and superb sound throughout the entire frequency range - very good mid-range and treble also...  you hear every note the way it was meant to be heard.<br /><br />I would recommend that you do the following with all earbuds and/or &#34;ear headphones&#34; that you like - if the cord is a little thin (as this cord is), where it connects to the earpiece, take a little drop of &#34;Gorilla Glue,&#34; and LET IT DRY.  If you tend to pull the earpiece out of your ear by pulling on the cord as I have the bad habit of doing sometimes, this will prevent the connection from coming loose and potentially losing sound.<br /><br />Getting back to the review of these however, I don't know what other reviewers are listening to when they claim these have a &#34;thin sounding&#34; bass, etc., but they are certainly entitled to their opinions.  Perhaps it is the source they're listening to them with.  To me, as stated above, these sound excellent throughout, and I recommend them VERY HIGHLY.",Positive,2,2
"Amazing headphones for the price.  I have a pair of Beats Studio Wireless which are my primary headphones at home, but have an apartment for work and needed a second pair.  I tried these after testing them at BestBuy.  I have to say, I like these better than the Beats (and at almost half the cost!)  The bass is fun (and I love bass).  They have a crazy long batter life, excellent controls that are easy to work without looking and are the most comfortable on-ear headphones I have owned.  (I also have Harman Kardon's).  Outstanding buy at $150.  Go for it - you won't regret it.",Positive,2,2

"Is there something about the color of that Bluedio HT. Yes definitely! The color stands out, the color is actually symbolic to my usage of what a realistic design of a head phone should be. It is the first of its kind I have ever experienced. Luckily it happened to be red. I always thought black was worth it but for a change I tried red in my selection. In any product you have to be align with that one specific color that will make that product valuable and symbolic to you. I can only speak for my experience. I love the red Bluedio HT. But you know what I like the most, Its quality, I believe it was made to withstand a large amount of force applied to it. I can testify to this, my sister normally falls asleep with this head phone in her ears. Great right. I always find myself taking it off of her because I'm afraid she damages it. Guess what I do when I take it off of her, its my time, I'll connect to my WiFi, load a movie and enjoy the second best part of having a Red Bluedio, the sound, what a transformation, this is a piece of technology that captures the heart of the technologist and more so, to consumers who are 10 times sure a product like this is worth having. Whenever I listen to the sound effects I literally want to just taste the pleasure of such sound. It's like my favourite DQ ice cream. Don't get me wrong I can buy DQ ice cream while listening to my favourite Ellie Goulding selection. The thing is I will never get the chance to feel what musicians are able to feel unless I'm lucky enough to put my hands on the things musicians like. And the Bluedio HT is definitely a recommendation. I remember one night I was amaze of the perfection of the sound effect. I turned it up in one of my craziest moment dancing to the beautiful beats. My sister laughed me. I know I was lost. Thanks to this piece of technology. I must say this, the power of Bluetooth will always make us talk safer when wirelessly connected to the phone. No hands on, isn't that perfect. I thinkso!",Positive,2,2
I used this splitter for one year and 11 days.  It no longer functions.  I had it hooked up to a 65 inch and a 42 inch TV.

"[[VIDEOID:aef2960dfec761d8316408574cdf78a5]] The iGadgitz Volcano Bluetooth speaker is one of the more unusual speakers I have seen and used. It is a small speaker with unusual controls. Unusual in this case is not a bad thing, though - this is a good speaker that works well.<br /><br />This is a small and attractive little speaker, a little smaller than a 1-cup measure. It is a cylinder with a recessed speaker in the middle of th top, hence the name. It has a brushed steel finish on th outside and overall is not unattractive.<br /><br />I ran into a slight problem when I was testing with it that proved to be a minor issue and was easily remedied - in the middle of testing, it ran out of battery power. When the battery was exhausted, the speaker simply cut off with no indicator that the issue was coming. While that's ok, it would have been nice to have had a little warning that the battery was dying. Other than this little detail, this speaker has not given me any issues at all.<br /><br />It pairs and connects with no issue. When turned on and set to pair, it broadcasts its ID as \\""Volcano 2\\"". I paired it to my phone and it very connected and was ready to go in a few seconds, faster than most other speakers I have used.<br /><br />I fed some music to it and it demonstrated a good sound profile. The bass is a little soft but not unacceptable. The midrange is good and as a result the music has a decent amount of depth, sounding neither hollow or like it came from a tunnel. The highs are good and are very clear. When it comes to the sound profile of Bluetooth speakers many tend to overdrive the bass and kill the midrange, but this one is better with the midrange - very much preferable.<br /><br />Where this speaker gets interesting is in the volume control. The control is actually a movable ring on the underside of the speaker and by turning the speaker while it's on a flat surface it is possible to adjust the volume up or down. It took me a little practice to get this right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure. This is one of those rare cases with a Bluetooth speaker where I do recommend reading the included documentation.<br /><br />Operating range is somewhere between 30' and 35' before it starts to cut out or stutter. This is above average and just makes this speaker even better.<br /><br />I like this speaker. It has good sound, good range and interesting controls. The fact that it looks cool is a bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure.

"The product itself works fine, when you get it to work. Mine shipped with damaged tact switches. The source button did not work at all, completely gone; the 5.1/2.1 button is functional but also badly damaged. I jumped the two leads to make the device select composite, and aside from that major annoyance (if you don't know basics about electronic boards, you're in for a bad time) the device works as described. Sounds pretty nice, made me smile when I got it to run correctly. It ships with a flimsy optical cable, but I wasn't actually expecting that at all. That was a nice surprise.<br />The tact switches were not.<br />So I'm not exactly pleased. I'll be contacting the seller to see if I can't get a replacement because for $50 this is honestly a damn shame.",Negative,0,0

"I realize that this was an inexpensive speaker but I did expect it to work more than three or four times.  The first time I used it, I was very impressed with the sound.  After a couple of times using it though, it began to stop during play and would not reconnect thru Bluetooth. Then the last time I tried to use it, a few days ago, it made a beeping sound and quit completely.  I thought maybe it needed to be recharged, but that didn't help. It seems to have no power now at all.  There is a small blue light that displays when it is turned on and that light does not come on now either.  Since it has been just over 30 days since I bought it, I can't return it so I'm stuck with a dead speaker.  I would not recommend this speaker at all.",Negative,1,0

"These headphones get one star for the sound - It wasn't the absolute best I've ever heard but it was pretty good. If you are looking for bass, these are not the ones you want. But the mid and treble sound pretty clear and the noise cancellation is pretty good too. The second start comes from the good idea that these are adjustable, foldable to be compact, and the earphones have great, comfortable padding.  So why not the full 5 stars? Because they broke in less than 20-25 uses. I give the range because I wasn't counting how many times I wore these because I didn't think I'd have to. I thought these would be a lifetime purchase. But nope, I would definitely say I only wore them 20-25 times and they broke - in multiple places.  How'd they brake, you ask? It was due to the cheap, fragile plastic these headphones are made of. Well, I should be specific, the headband portion is a cheap, fragile casing made of cheap, fragile plastic. Within the casing are lightweight metal pieces on both sides - which you see when you adjust the headphones to be bigger.  So basically, although the bands were adjustable, the plastic wasn't very malleable or sturdy. Over time, the headband cracked in multiple places in attempts to fit over my head - and my hair. But, let's be real, hair can be flattened down and I certainly could do that to mine! So that shouldn't have wore down my headphones by any means if they were made well.  Now I will be honest - I have an afro so that makes my head a little bigger than normal. But we'e not talking some Leela James afro - feel free to Google it since I can't create a hyperlink.  I'm talking about the size of Toph Beifong afro - feel free to Google it since I can't create a hyperlink. - Ok i know her hair isn't an afro but that is the kind of volume to my hair we are talking about.  Before, it was a small plastic piece that broke off on one side, and then another piece broke off the other. Eventually, a piece on the top of the headband that connected the right side to the whole headphone completely broke off. So my headphones suddenly became two separate pieces and the decision came to throw them in the trash.  So if you have a smaller head with no fro, maybe these are for you. But be warned, the plastic is cheap. My dad has a pair of  Panasonic RP-HC70 headphones that were made better - I can wear them over my head with no cracks or fear of fragility. I would recommend those except they are discontinued by the manufaturer (though they are sold here on Amazon by independent sellers) and the sound isn't as great.

"Notice: I received a free product sample in exchange for writing an unbiased review. The manufacturer has no influence on my review or score.<br /><br />I long ago learned that expensive cables whether HDMI or otherwise is more marketing than picture or sound quality (looking at you Monster Cable) and have been steadfastly buying most of my cables from Monoprice or using AmazonBasics branded cables.<br /><br />I received this 5m cable and had a specific use in mind for my basement where I was intending on doing some rearranging and wanted a long run of HDMI cable. I've had this cable running from an A/V stack in a corner closet to my plasma TV for the better part of two months and it's worked great! I've had no visible impact to picture quality or any other issue of any kind.<br /><br />Comparing this HDMI cable versus Monoprice and AmazonBasics I'd give the nod to AmazonBasics in terms of overall build quality and look and feel.

"This review is for the DBPOWER® Black NFC-Enabled Bluetooth 4.0 Music Audio Receiver.<br /><br />The DBPOWER Bluetooth adapter (also available from other sellers like ESYNiC) is designed to add Bluetooth support to sound output devices that don't support it. For example, devices like speaker docks, speakers, sound systems, etc., even car sound systems. Connect the DBPOWER adapter to the line-in/aux input of the device, pair it with your audio playback device (mobile phone, for example) and stream audio. It doesn't contain a speaker itself - any audio is played back through the speakers of the device it's plugged in to.<br /><br />For example: Mobile phone → (Bluetooth) → DBPOWER adapter → Sound system<br /><br />The packaging includes:<br />• The DBPOWER adapter<br />• A 3.5mm male-to-male jack<br />• Mini USB charging cable<br />• Small instruction booklet<br />The adapter itself is small (about 5cm across) and it weighs only 68g. It is rechargeable and a Mini USB cable is provided for this purpose.<br /><br />Pairing with the adapter for the first time is easy. Hold down the power button and it automatically enters pairing mode. It should then appear in the settings of the Bluetooth device you want to pair it with. Once paired, audio should play back over Bluetooth via the DBPOWER device through the connected sound output.<br /><br />I had no problems pairing it with my iPhone 6 and sound quality through various connected playback devices (sound system, older iPod dock) was excellent. I even connected it to a pair of high-end headphones to see just how good the audio quality was - I was very impressed.<br /><br />It has a built-in microphone so can also be used for hands-free calling, making it ideal for use in the car when connected to the aux-input of a car sound system. You do need to be sitting quite close to the adapter for the microphone to work well though - beyond about 5cm it becomes difficult for the other party on the call to hear you.<br /><br />It does support NFC for easy pairing but unfortunately I haven't been able to use that as I don't have a device that supports it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy setup<br />+ Excellent sound quality (supports Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP)<br />+ Rechargeable battery<br />+ Works well as a speaker phone<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No battery life indicator<br />- Speaker phone microphone distance poor<br /><br />I'm very impressed with the DBPOWER Bluetooth adapter. It's easy to setup, works exactly as described and the sound quality is excellent. Recommended.s support NFC for easy pairing but unfortunately I haven't been able to use that as I don't have a device that supports it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy setup<br />+ Excellent sound quality (supports Bluetooth 4.0 A2DP)<br />+ Rechargeable battery<br />+ Works well as a speaker phone<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No battery life indicator<br />- Speaker phone microphone distance poor<br /><br />I'm very impressed with the DBPOWER Bluetooth adapter.

"The Polk Monitors are fantastic budget speakers, if paired with an amp that can provide a lot of clean power (&#62; 100 watts per channel).  These are attractive speakers that put out a nice, slightly warm sound without being fatiguing. They are not quite full-range speakers, so if you're a bass head, you will want a good subwoofer.  Also, they get better sounding as you listen to them more over time.<br /><br />In addition to powering these speakers with a good amp, they will take a while to break in.  When I first got mine, I thought they seemed somewhat dull and muffled, and the tweeters exhibited some sibilance.  But my patience was rewarded, as with use over a period of several months, the treble mellowed and the sound became very clear.  After a couple of years, they sound even better now.<br /><br />Finally, these speakers are somewhat laid back.  If you're into forward, in your face sound, these probably aren't for you.  But if you prefer a more natural, balanced and musical sound, then you will probably enjoy these speakers.",Positive,1,2
yes yes very good sound .nearly blew me head off did not think such a small speaker could sound so good,Positive,2,2
This item came defective. I am trying to return it and they are giving me the run around. I have given them a description of the problem. They even state it was used. We are a repair shop....we know if it is bad or not. When a laser won't read and makes a clicking sound....it's bad!,Negative,0,0

"I have had this device for about 6 months and I have seen what is has to offer. It worked fine for the first 2 months or so. After that I would get spotty performance that seemed to improve by toggling the blue tooth on my devices. Now it does not really work at all. It will play for 10-15 seconds and then cut out for 5 seconds. This happens on all devices a I have used with it, an iPad, Samsung phone, windows PC.<br /><br />I love the idea and if it were reliable it would be great but the performance is not consistent and I would not buy. I will keep looking for a blue tooth amplifier, I also had a bed experience with a Pyle failing right out of the box.",Negative,1,0

"The 5GHz Wireless HDMI Streaming Media Player Wi-Fi Display Dongle by EZ cast, is a brilliant way to stream things on to your TV from any of your devices, its quick and easy to use and the design can go with any TV that you can think of.<br /><br />It is incredibly easy to use, just by following the instructions that will be provided, as I stated above you can stream from any device, this includes, phones preferably ios phones like iPhones and co, Android phones, ios tablets like the iPad and from any windows and apple mac laptops. As long as you have Wi-Fi you will be well on your way to streaming things through your devices. The device is quite small like a USB stick and very stylish, as long as you have a HDMI port (like majority of TV's do) you should be fine. The picture quality is fantastic, I couldn’t ask for any better!<br /><br />If you are looking for an easier way to stream from any of your devices, I would highly suggest this product, I give it 10/10 for everything and the service provided was fantastic.<br /><br />Thank you very much!",Positive,2,2

"These are now my standard earbud. They last me about a year with heavy usage (and many encounters with fixed objects and dogs who pull them out of my ears), which is at least double the amount of time other earbuds have lasted me.<br /><br />The tip choices include ones large enough for my ears, and are comfortable. They are VERY efficient, requiring very little volume to drive them. They are somewhat bass-heavy (which is fine with me), and the treble isn't tinny or shrill.<br /><br /> They are the best sounding, most reliable earbuds I've found at a price I'm willing to pay. I like them a lot, and will continue to buy them.",Positive,2,2
"If you don't have room for this antenna on same table or shelf as your TV, you are out of luck.  My TV stand is about waist-high, and this antenna has to dangle in mid-air as the cable is too short to reach the floor.  Had to make awkward re-arrangements to fit this antenna into my setting.  Works pretty well, though, but no better than old $19 RCA antenna from Wal-Mart.",Neutral,2,1

"After a severe foot injury took me away from my true passion of running, I was panic stricken and depressed, as the doc told me the only thing I can really do is swim.

I would be lucky to finish 10 laps!<br /><br />I am happy to report that with Waterfi, I am up to 100 laps per day and now swim almost an hour every day. The trick to having the earpiece stay in, is placing them into your ears (snug) while they are dry! It seals them in when they hit the water.  90% of the time I have no issue with them popping out.  My first week was rough, until I figured out the place them while they are dry trick!",Positive,2,2

"Full confession that these are the first pair of &#34;nice&#34; headphones I've ever bought for myself - but for my untrained ears, the sound quality of these headphones is excellent.  In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, they are exceedingly comfortable.  I can wear them for hours on end (and often do) without feeling any discomfort.  They are definitely not noise-canceling, but do a very good job of dimming background noise for an office setting.  Would absolutely recommend and buy again!",Positive,2,2

"I bought this to mainly use for its voice recording for college classes.  It is so clear, that once you put it down to record, you really should avoid moving it.  You hear the sound of it being moved real loud in the head phones during playback.  I put some tunes on it, and it plays well.  It even plays well through mini speakers.  It is very basic. Doesn't have the bells and whistles like a $150.00 mp3 player.  But if you just need it to play music or record, this device is for you.  And it is so light weight and fits into any pocket.  It does come with instructions that did not match up exactly, but it's so basic that just sitting with it for 10/15 minutes you can figure it out.  I have only owned 1 mp3 player before this and I bought that 8 years ago.  So I am not that savvy when it comes to these things and I figured it out.",Positive,2,2

"My youngest son has been wanting a new set of In Ear Headphones and I seen these and decided to try them out. Usually I would pick up a pair at a local shopping center however they never sound all the great or last very long for us.<br /><br />This set is a nice set. It comes in a case that my son thought was &#34;cool&#34;. This set comes with several different sized ear pieces that can be attached, which is nice because my son is quite picky with how things fit inside his ears. I was actually the first one to use these to make sure that they was going to work correctly. These are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I watched a full movie with these and listened to some music afterwards. These was very clear sounding, have a nice volume. The noise cancelling on these works well. They do not block out all noises when using them, however they do block out most. These are very nice looking and have a strong durable cord to them. These are working out well for my son and he uses them quite often, They are actually the set he uses at school since the are comfortable to wear and he has to use headphones most of the day at school as they have switched from using books to tablets for their studies.<br /><br />I received this product Free of charge for the purpose of inspecting and reviewing.

"earbuds is exactly as described by the manufacurer. Crisp clear sound with  low deep bass. I maxed the volume and there's not an iota of distortion.  This earbuds has the same sound quality as the Yamaha EPH - 20 BR (see my review). it is only $19 but without the microphone. If you don't care having a mic and a lifetime warranty, i highly recommed the Yamaha, which is $40 cheaper than this. However, I love the mic on thus earbuds - with volume cintrol, rewind, forward, pause, and play plus a lifetime warranty - this can't be beat.  i owned earbuds from $15 to $159, and the yamaha and this one are the beat by far in terms of sound quality and price.  in addition, the buds fit my ears perfectly and the noise cancellation is superb. The flat wire seems durable  UPDATE: 8/27 -I initially gave this a 5 star rating but  two weeks, the in-line mic performed awfully.

"It's a great radio, made better if you know how to access the 'hidden functions'. See the Yahoo PL-880 group for more info. A worthwhile addition for desk/table use is the $9.99 (Amazon) plastic stand, which holds it at a decent angle for easy use. The main fault - as expected as it is a small portable without internal volume that could house a group of input bandpass filters - is the CM/IM problem. I hooked mine to my attic mounted Pixel Pro-1a wideband (0.1 - 30 MHz) amplified loop and experienced my local religious powerhouse (50 kW daytime) AM BC-er - WXJC 850 kHz - underneath even morning SW powerhouses R. Australia 9,580 kHz and WRMI 9,950 kHz, both peaking 58-61 db on 'DX' setting - and still present on 'Local', the greatest attenuation. The local station cannot be heard on my tabletop radios, including an Icom R75, a pair of Lowes, etc - they have bandpass filters/better shielding/MW-reject filters. Clearly, you can use 'too much antenna' with the PL-880. It has many fine attributes, making it a 'must have' for travel, emergencies, or casual listening.

"I purchase these because of the sport capabilities.  I like the ear hooks and I need the control so I could stop or use the volume or answer a call.  They look really nice, cool to see all the parts inside, etc.  Then I used them.  Basically the main issue is the sound was terrible.  I've only ever owned one brand of the superior sound headphones so I don't know how qualified I am to judge but yikes these are terrible.  There was no depth, no bass and the volume was limited.  You could barely hear out of them.  Next the ear hooks made it impossible to put these on without stopping looking for the &#34;L&#34; and then fitting them into your ear after several tries to find the right direction and angle to fit in your ear.  After you did that, they did exactly what they were supposed to do and stayed in your ears.  That's the one star, they stay in your ear when you are in motion.  Of course you'd have to sing the songs yourself so you could hear, but that's minor right?",Negative,1,0
"It works fine once you figure out the nuances.  There is no ON/OFF button - if the receiver is in place it just comes on.  The really strange thing about this is the electric plug.

"Got the bulb in two days as promised! The picture is very sharp, and we are very satisfied with our purchase thus far! We tried a knock-off lamp first, thinking we could save some money, only to have it last a couple months.

"The speakers are primarily designed for outdoor use because the mounds require that you have to assemble them to wall. They cannot stand freely on their own. However, there are two problems with the speakers. The first problem is that the power supply is not rated for outdoors so I would not leave it outdoors. The second problem is that the Bluetooth range is less than 30 feet. As such the speakers are useless for outdoors. I would think that you would at least need to 100 feet range.",Negative,1,0

An adjustable headband would have taken care of that.  Plus it said her computer was to old for using bluetooth.  Plus she now knows she needs over the ear ones.  So we are sending them back.

"Very happy with my speaker, which I've had for a little over a year.  Volume is more than adequate for my purposes and sound is pretty good especially for the price.  Aside from using it for music, I connect it to my TV because its built-in speakers are not so good, and Sharkk provides better sound to my ears.  The speaker is heavier than I expected, with a solid feel and build.  It's not something I can put in my bag and walk around with (but I didn't get it for that purpose so I'm not complaining).  The voice sounds everybody complains about do not bother me, but in a quiet place, it is definitely loud.  A lighter beep would have served the same purpose and be less intrusive to those who mind.  The tone it plays when the battery is low does interfere with your listening.  If I play music when I go to sleep, I have to cover the light on the top corner because it bothers me.  I haven't used the speaker for phone calls, so can't comment there.  One thing I don't like is the amount of time you need to keep pressing the &#34;on&#34; button before the unit actually turns on.  These are very minor gripes, I'm really pleased with my purchase and it is very good value for money.  Battery life is very good, too.  I haven't made a point of testing how many hours it lasts, but it lasts long enough that I don't have to worry about charging it for over a week at least.  For someone looking at this price point, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",Positive,2,2

"This amp may be ok but but perhaps I was hoping for too much from it. I have a clearstream v2 antenna mounted in the attic which is a great antenna for my location as I get all the stations I'm suppose to.  Several stations I get have transmitters that are 62 miles away and a couple are 85 miles and I get flawless reception without an amp. There is one station however I was particularly interested in picking up which is broadcast from the same location as the other 85 mile stations I get but apparently the signal is weaker and the V2 doesn't recognize it so I thought a little extra boost may be just the ticket to get it locked in. Nope, didn't happen. I rotated the antenna a bit thinking maybe that would help but it didn't and then the antenna was facing about 15 deg the wrong way. As an experiment I left the antenna in the new position and disconnected the amp to see what affect it would have on the reception from the other channels. Some were less than good and when reconnecting the amp they were fine again so the amp is working.  Obviously factors are involved trying to pick up the station I'm after which I doubt any amp could help so I can't say this one is no good..it can only do so much. Factoring in the stations and distances I'm already receiving I'm reasonably confident hooking this amp to an outdoor antenna will do the trick.",Neutral,1,1

"This is a review of the Sony SRSX77 portable speaker.  I received it at no cost as an evaluation unit for review.  These are my honest comments written from the POV I take when I've paid for an item.<br /><br />This is a pretty substantial item, comparable in size and weight to a house brick.  There are smaller and lighter competitors out there (see photo showing it next to a Bose Soundlink Mini).  It belts out the tunes with plenty of volume for a bedroom, study or office and yes, it's portable, but its size and weight really suggest a mostly stationary role.  I'm hearing punchy bass, nice mids and sparkly highs.  Heavy bass will rattle stuff on the table with the speaker.  You don't feel it like you would with a subwoofer but you can clearly hear low frequency notes, not just a bit of percussive noise that wants to be that low note if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Sony offers a free app called Song Pal that you can use as a remote control for the speaker on an Android or iOS device.  You use it to select a preset equalization or set your own, control how long the speaker idles before automatically powering down, Google Cast settings and other general operational-type stuff.  Song Pal can also be used as a music player.  I have to admit that I found Song Pal a little tedious in that role and I found it most useful to tweak settings on the speaker.  I used other apps that I'm already familiar with (e.g. Amazon Music, RadioTunes) to play tunes.<br /><br />I told a friend that I was going to review this and he loaned me his Bose Soundlink Mini to compare.  The two don't compete directly (this Sony costs ~64% more than the Bose at this writing).  The Sony is louder, more interface-able, has crazy longer battery life and sounds a lot better to me.  But the Bose is much more portable and would suit me better for use in a product demo or a hotel room, and it sounds awfully good.  This isn't a review of the Bose; I bring it up to make the point that whether the Sony isright for your application depends on how you want to use a device like this.  I'm liking it for ambient tunes in my kitchen/dining area.  It turns my phone or tablet into an exceptional table radio, and it could serve as a complete audio system for a guest or kids room TV (you can plug it into a 3.5&#34; jack too).  I'm giving it 5 stars because even at this price point, I think it succeeds at what it's trying to be.<br /><br />Pic compares size of Oontz XL, Bose Soundlink Mini and Sony SRSX77.",Positive,2,2

"Amps aren't supposed to make headphones sound &#34;better&#34;. Only louder. Sometimes that loudness can translate to hearing more sounds from the source, but it doesn't do anything to the sound itself (unless you choose the EQ options).<br /><br />I came in with this expectation, hoping to be pleasantly surprised by all of the good reviews, and I have to admit, I'm rather disappointed. It's not that the amp doesn't work - it certainly does amplify the sound, but not by much. I've never used it on any volume except max, and even then I find myself turning up my iPod or portable video game consoles to hear the sound more clearly. It only makes up for a few notches on the source volume slider, and that's with the amp turned all the way up.<br /><br />I don't feel ripped off, but I do feel disappointed. At least the construction quality is good, and the battery life is... okay. I usually get a few hours - maybe three? It's hard to tell when I don't listen all at once. Charging it is simple.<br /><br />All in all, I would've felt much more satisfied if I had bought this at a $20 price point. It's not bad, but don't expect anything amazing. My Audio-Technica M50 headphones don't have that high of an impedance, either - 38 ohms.",Neutral,1,1
Great sounding headphones. Comes in a convenient bag with snap close opening to keep everything inside. Very hardy cord but time will tell how tough the joints really are. The metal on the headphones and cable are light enough to not notice they are there at all but sturdy enough to not worry about just tossing them in your bag. Over all great headphones and sound and build quality is on par with my 100$ headphones. Would highly suggest and will put them through the ringer on my next snowboarding trip.,Positive,2,2

"I've had this radio for 3 years and had difficulty turning in most AM stations.  Luckily, the two AM/FM stations I wanted to listen to came in late at night, so the radio served its purpose.  Recently I accidently knocked it off the night stand (it only fell 2 feet to a carpeted surface), but lost all AM reception.  Still get the FM stations, but to me it's useless unless I can get both.  I live in Tulsa, OK and never understood why I could only get one AM station. Everything else seemed to work fine. No sure I can send it back for repairs.",Negative,1,0
"Finally got this installed at the in-laws. Old style aerial antenna antenna (but supposedly made for HD digital). You know the ones that look like they would make a good clothes rack. Well, it got in about 25 channels when they first put it in (metro area, but still not much on). Then he tried splitting the signal and sending it all over the house. That dropped the signal strength to where the first TV could get 8 channels, the second could get 4, and none of the others got any channels.<br />So we ordered this to try and boost the signal. First off, the bad news (not for the product, but for my review). I don't think you can really put a splitter between the power injector and the amplifier module. So for me to install this he way he had it set up, I'd need a second hole in the wall, which we weren't ready to do.<br />So we went back to the antenna feeding just the one living room TV again. With this in place, we went from about 25 channels to 90 channels (granted 15 or 20 of them wound up just being music, go figure).<br />And I got some major brownie points with the in-laws.",Positive,1,2
"Pleasantly surprised. Not audiophile quality like what I finally replaced after many years but they do sound pretty good. The sub-woofer is fairly impressive but will flutter if over driven. I didn't think We would get a balanced sound with the tiny drivers in the center and surround but they do sound quite good actually. Great deal for the price. I bought them thinking I might upgrade down the road, now I really don't think I need to after having them for a few weeks.",Positive,2,2

"My 76 year old dad loves them. He's had numerous others over the years. Super cool how it mutes itself when a call comes into his iPhone, and that it can connect to two Bluetooth devices (the tv thingy and smartphone) at once. The speakers must be real good, because his old headphones, even over the rear types, you could hear the speakers. I never hear the tv coming thru his VOXOOM headset.

"I love this speaker. I already own the Sharkk Boombox and have really enjoyed that product. The Sharkk 2o has taken an already great speaker and made it better. I typically use my portable speaker outdoors when I am in the pool or hot tub (or various random locations usually with a bottle of beer nearby). While I have never knocked my speaker in a body of water, I am always worried about it getting splashed or spilled on or dripped on. The 2o takes care of that concern by making this speaker waterproof. I love being able to listen to music near the water without being vigilant about my young daughter being too splashy or accidentally tipping a drink onto my speaker.<br />The unit sounds great and has a long lasting battery. I have been using it all weekend, probably about 6 hours total and haven't needed to charge it up (in fact it still has 2 of the 3 display lights lit up which indicate the amount of charge remaining). I love both the long battery life and the remaining charge display features. Few things are worse than thinking you have a party's worth of charge and then having the battery on your speaker die.<br />The speaker comes with an audio aux. cable so that you can connect it to your music source if you want to conserve charge or do not have bluetooth capability. It also features a micro SD card slot so you can play music even without a smart phone or mp3 player. I tried this feature out and thought it was great. You can even skip songs with the buttons on top of the unit. All of the jacks and the card slot are protected by a removable rubber flap to keep moisture and dirt out. It closes easily by pushing in but I ran my finger around the edge of the flap firmly to make sure it was properly sealed.<br />I found it easy to connect to my phone, you simply turn on the speaker, turn your music player's the bluetooth on and hold down the play/pause button and it tells you when it is connected (it actually says &#34;connected&#34; so there is no doubt).<br />I love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound. I find myself using more than my in home stereo system because it sounds so great and I can take it with me where I go (it even comes with a velcro carrying strap).<br />I have tried many wireless speakers and this is my favorite by far. I have lost more than one due to dropping (in water and on hard surfaces) so knowing that this is waterproof and shockproof is very reassuring.<br />I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants big sound in a small, waterproof package.<br />Note: I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound.

"Had these since Aug 2015. They are connected to L&R RCA cables that go to a ¼&#34; headphone jack that hooks to my computer. So I am able to hook up the RCA cables to the guitar jacks on mixer with pan pot set right to get stereo, and I get two mid range controls instead of just L&R. They have never had any problems even though they have been disconnected and reconnected over 100 times since then from the mixing board.",Positive,2,2

Very well built and better than I would have expected for the price. The instructions however were pretty terrible. I would recommend watching a video on installing before you try to follow the instructions.  The process was pretty much the reverse of what it should be. Other than that it was better than expected.,Positive,2,2
"After buying three mounts and not being satisfied with any of them I can across this one. I have to say I'm satisfied, it is one piece unlike most other products.  The arms attached to the TV have four hooks (instead of two or four). All hardware needed to install is included. I used my own lag screws because the included 3/8&#34; with 1/2 drive  with included washers were a little too small for the holes (in my opinion).  The only negative is the bubble level, but I won't take any stars off for that  because just about every mount with an included bubble level has the same issue.<br /><br />One huge mistake in design was made with this one. The bolts will be in the way when moving the tv into place. Because this mount has more hooks those hooks will interfere with the bolts giving it limited range of motion. I’d recommend you to say away from this one. It is very sturdy however so are most.",Negative,2,0
"I know, it is hard to get excited over a humble cable, but I think it is always worth getting decent cables; I’ve spent a fortune on cabled for the TV and surround-sound system and I’m convinced it is worth every penny. This appears to be a very well manufactured cable; the gold plated jacks are a snug and positive fit and the junction with the cable is robust with no play while the cable itself seems uncommonly resistant to the usual Gordian knot syndrome.<br /><br />There is not much more to say -this is a robust and high quality cable and well worth the modest price tag. Thanks to Allreli for providing a free sample in return for an honest review.",Positive,2,2
"This is a great TABLETOP radio.  The description stating that it's small enough to fit into a pocket or purse is pure rubbish.  Like another reviewer, I was expecting something much smaller (to fit into my Go Bag) and was rather stunned when I took it out of the box.  It's pretty big, and heavy, as the dimensions, which I apparently failed to notice, DO state, (mea culpa).  Also, the statement that the tuner is lit up by LED led me to believe that the frequency range window was lit up for night viewing.  That is not the case.  What happens is that when a station is locked in, a small red LED light comes on.  Kind of unnecessary, since anybody who has ever used a tuning dial can hear when the station is clearly dialed.<br /><br />Otherwise, it appears to be a well built, no frills radio that uses both AC and batteries, thus making it handy to have in the house.  For my Go Bag, I have ordered the following.  We'll see how it works out.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020S7XK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00",Positive,2,2

"Bought it and really didn't use.  Just started using it,  worked great once.  Put it on the charger for the 2nd time and it won't even charge.  Tried to replace it since it's only been a couple months.  But no answer....",Negative,1,0
"PRO: First off, it does exactly what I needed. It splits my media playback  devices to my TV and my projector. I haven't noticed losing signal to the long run to my PJ so far, and I was actually surprised to see that it's not an either/or switch. I can view the same, or alternative programming on each output. An unexpected plus, as it allows me to have a gigantic PIP in my entertainment system if I choose. I was concerned about audio sync, but so far, I haven't seen any delay in the audio. That's another big plus.<br /><br />CON: The negative aspects will be apparent as soon as you start to connect it. the input/output layout is just plain awful. I got 12 inch HDMI cables to go with this so I could make very short runs to my devices and my receiver. That part is great and highly recommended, because you will have trouble getting it to lay flat because cables are coming out of 3 of the 4 sides of it. It's nice to look at out of the box, but in practice, it's clumsy and awkward looking in your home theater setup. With a BRP, Cable Box, Streaming player, and soon to be game console, it looks like an insect when all the slots are in use. Customers would be better served if they had given up some of the compact design to make a bigger box that had all the inputs and outputs on the back.<br /><br />The only other glaring issue is that, as is the case with most of those credit card remotes, the responsiveness of the remote/IR receiver connection is dubious. It can sometimes take several attempts to make it switch. It's not a deal breaker, but for $50+, I'd rather have a stronger connection, than a tiny remote that is just begging to get lost or broken.<br /><br />Conclusion: It's a handy thing to have in your media setup if you don't have a receiver with HDMI capability, and you need all your playback units to reach more than one Monitor/TV/PJ. You just have to accept that it's not going to be perfect",Positive,2,2

I love that this comes in a choice of colors. Black gets old. This product seems very sturdy. I think it will last a long while. I love that it was super simple to pair and could be used straight out of the box. I also like that you can answer calls and even texts using this with a windows phone. Turning the volume up without changing the song is tricky. Another drawback is I expected more sound out of this speaker. It ranks third loudest out of my families five Bluetooth speakers.,Positive,2,2

"Many people have problems with earphones. Either they don't fit, don't sound clear, break easily, or are just too expensive. Well, here's my review for these earphones. They are designed with rubber heads that are tilted sideways, so they ACTUALLY have the ability to fit and stay in your ear, with multiple sizes for those of you (like me) who think their earholes are physically challenged. Anyway, the RPHJE120R's sound great. Really, for the price, they sound just as good if not better than apple's 30$ earphones. No complaints in that department. In terms of physical quality, I do not know how easy it is to have them break, but most people suffer the plague of one ear not working and the works. It happens, I suggest buying a small case to wrap your headphones in, instead of tossing them around or shoving them in your pocket, that's how they break. It is a huge bang for the buck!",Positive,2,2
Really easy to mount. Works fine. 4 stars because not enough room between mount and wall for cable in back of TV had to use HDMI port on side of TV.,Positive,2,2

My family and I love to listen to music when we are on the go. Using Audio Cable's to connect our phones or mp3 devices to the car allows us to take our favorite music with us wherever we go. I was delighted to have the opportunity to purchase APXX 2-Pack 3 Ft 3.5mm Male To Male Stereo Gold Plated Audio Cable at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. When i opened the box I was impressed by several things. 1. there were 2 in the package 2. The polished look made them appear to be high quality 3. they felt very sturdy. I tested them out this morning during my one hour commute to work. They worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend tese audio cables to others.

"I purchased the Pocke Talker for my 94 year old mother.  She has hearing aides but does not like them because she hears more background than the voices of the people talking to her.  She loves the Pocke Talker!  It filters out background noise and projects the voice of person talking.  She can finally hear what is actually being said and respond appropriately!  The Pocke Talker has been a God-send for Doctor visits, watching television and assisting with phone calls (she puts the speaker on and sets phone head aside).  I highly recommend the Pocke Talker to anyone struggling to hear!  I personally think the Pocke Talker has been more helpful than her $4,000.00 hearing aides!!!

"UPDATE: My first pair broke just under a year after purchase, after months of mistreatment and abuse in day to day usage. (I'm rather clumsy, honestly.) I vaguely considered RMAing them, but it seems Panasonic's consumer-facing returns/repairs structure has changed and the warranty these came under is no longer honored. Or maybe it is and I just can't find it. I don't know or particularly care; I gave up and just bought a new pair off Amazon, and that's what I'll keep doing every time a pair breaks, until they discontinue them. The sound quality is good, they're at a great price point, and the light purple color they come in is cute. That's all I could possibly ask for, really.",Positive,2,2

"While the sound for this small waterproof speaker is not as full as I'd like, its benefits as a portable, outdoor speaker make it a good choice. It has a large suction cup on back to attach it to glass, shower wall, or another smooth, glossy surface, and it can be clipped to a backpack, tote, or other object. The volume gets really loud for a party or for when you want your music blasting. The battery life is great, too. It's small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, about a 3.5&#34; diameter and 1.5&#34; thick, excluding the suction cup.<br /><br />If you're okay with adequate base and somewhat thin highs -- not bad sound, just not fantastic sound -- then this might be for you. The portable and waterproof design makes it a nice choice for the beach, pool, shower, or camping. Note: I received a sample for review.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",Positive,1,2

"I like these speakers a lot they are beautiful to look at and sound nice and warm. They lack a little bit of mid range. However  I own 4 sets of powered  bluetooth speakers and probably like these the least. The largest draw back of these for me is the lack of sub out. they are probably  the nicest looking but are the in my bedroom because they are the least connectable and of course lack the sub out feature. There is no way to adjust the tone. I have a set of Presonus 3.5, Presonus 4.5 and Boston Acoustics digital cinema which are all excellent.<br />All of these speakers I paid between 100 and 150 for  including the Polks. They are great speakers but there is stiff competition with better feature sets for less money. I choose usability over looks any day.",Positive,2,2

This is the first pair of speakers that I've incorporated as L/R surrounds into a &#34;7.1&#34; system that were not direct firing radiators.  I am happily impressed with the overall clarity, range, and the &#34;diffuse&#34; effect of the sound.  While they don't completely &#34;disappear&#34; from their assigned channel, having the speakers in such an orientation really does seem to add an effect of a smoother transition in sound from the front mains to the surround back channels (which are direct radiating speakers).  Would definitely recommend and perhaps purchase Klipsch Reference speakers for all 7 channels in the future.",Positive,2,2

I was not sure how the sub amplifier would work with these. I wish the volume nob could also control the sub volume for what I'm using it for.

"Initially, I was against purchasing a bluetooth speaker; now I love it!  The sound is amazing for a speaker of this price range.  Our son has a Bose speaker for his iPod, and the Fluance Fi30 delivers the same sound quality at a much lower price.  Since we have another small bluetooth speaker on our patio, the Fluance speaker works perfectly with it...when we turn on the patio speaker, the Fluance speaker stops and the sound from our iPod transfers to the patio speaker.  We live in a small condo unit, and the Fluance Fi30 fills the unit with sound.  We haven't really cranked up the volume yet; we don't need to in order to hear our selected music comfortably.  Conclusion: this was an excellent purchase and a great value.",Positive,2,2

My expectations were high when i ordered this. 2 major disappointments. It does not have much volume. I have to have both my iPod and the Rugged cranked to be able to listen with clarity from more than 2m in my backyard. This drained my iPod quickly. Up close the sound is very good. There also doesn't seem to be much charging capacity. It charges well my cell and iPod up to about half charge. I can't charge them past that.  It is cool that i can use it independent of any AC  source. Handy when i painted my house. I have charged the rugged multiple times by sun and by ac . No change.  So as long as you can live with these limitations i recommend this.,Neutral,2,1

"I had an original pair of Pro4AA I bought new in the 70s that I gave to a friend when I moved. Later when looking to replace them and not being able to find any I bought a pair of Pro3AA Titanium. These seemed somewhat comparable in bass response to Pro4AA, are lighter and more comfortable but way too bright in the upper frequency range.  I found Koss had resurrected the Pro4AA so I bought those and was immediately disappointed. The similarity to the original is purely cosmetic; while a bit more comfortable than the original (they don't clamp on your head like a pair of vice grips) they don't sound anywhere near the same. Which brought me to the purchase of the Pro4AA Titanium... They are lighter and more comfortable to wear but sounded like crap: very hollow bass and lower midrange.  Quite accidently though I discovered if I pressed the earcups fairly firmly to my head they sounded remarkably like their original counterparts. After a bit of pondering it struck me- the difference was the liquid-filled ear cushions on the original 4AAs! The foam-filled cushions on the titanium are just too stiff and unpliable to conform around the ear and seal properly.  After brain-storming a bit I decided to 'ventilate' the cushions by perforating the backsides of them to let them be able to 'deflate'.  Bingo... not only did they feel more like the originals liquid ear cushions they now are sealing around my ears properly without pressing them  against my ears.  Problem solved.",Positive,1,2

"I am an audiophile, so yes, I am one of those sick folks that spent 10 years upgrading an audio system to get the most I can out of the sound.  I only listen to high quality music, and have spent well over 50k on audio equipment, so I know good sound, and can hear nuisances that everyday listeners can't.  For example, I listen to decay on bass notes, and treble to see how long the detail last before it trails off.  In other words, I listen for details that others miss.  When I am not home, I listen to my Triple fi 10s which go down to 10 hz, so they are fairly detailed.<br /><br />I say all of this because I recently replaced the cable with the Fiio cable in discussion, and immediately heard more detail when I hooked them up.  Maybe they fixed some of the issues that folks are complaining about because I have been walking around with them all day and not one noise or bad thump.  They are excellent cables and much better then the originals.  I don't find them to be stiff or cumbersome in any way, and not sure of the sounds others have heard.  My overall assessment of the cable is that they are much better then the originals and have excellent range, and are quiet.",Positive,2,2

Unfortunately, the HDMI side of the cable does NOT fit snugly into the HDMI port of the HDTV.  The cable wiggles.  I tried the cable on 2 different HDTVs with the same result.  The consequence of this is that the connection is unstable.  Any kind of wiggle and you lose the connection.  In fact, it was very hard to get a connection on one of my HDTVs.<br /><br />This cable simply doesn't work.",Negative,0,0
"I use this speaker to listen to news radio in my bathroom every day, but it is not in my shower. The news sounds good and music does, too. I used it a few times as a speaker phone and it sounded fine, but I kept it near me. Folks on the other end knew I was on a speaker, but had no problem hearing me. It pairs easily with multiple devices, works well and has good volume for a very small speaker. It holds a charge for over two hours which is fine for my needs and its size. Its size is great for my apartment bathroom with limited space. I have other bluetooth speakers that are larger, have better sound and longer battery life, but I definitely do not want them in my bathroom. In comparison, I purchased a splash resistant speaker from iHome for twice the money and it would not pair with multiple devices and the speaker phone did not work with my Samsung Note 3 and it went right back to the manufacturer.

"Terrible experience with Polk Audio.  This subwoofer worked fantastic for about 35 days before it blew up while running at low volume.  It blew a fuse.  Replacing fuses didn't help, they all blew immediately after turning it back on.  Amazon wouldn't replace it because I was 5 days beyond their 30 day return limit.<br /><br />So I called Polk Audio.  They determined it was the amplifier built into the subwoofer and said they would send me a new one but they were out of stock and it was going to take a month and a half to get me the replacement part because they don't stock them!!!  Seriously??? Polk Audio doesn't even stock replacement parts for their own products??  They refused to replace the entire unit and insisted I wait for the amp.<br /><br />After a month and a half of waiting for the replacement part, I called Polk Audio to see where the part was.  They had no record of me ordering the part and it will now be 3 more months before I get the replacement part.<br /><br />Save your money and DO NOT BUY POLK AUDIO!!!!!",Negative,0,0

I received the DODOcase Virtual Reality Cardboard kit at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased opinion. It fit very well for my Motorola Droid Ultra XT1080 however it does not hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 properly. The instructions for putting it together are not easily understood and somewhat difficult to follow however it only takes a bit of tampering with to figure it out on your own. They also include a video link in the manual for you to get visual instruction on putting it together. Made my arms a bit tired holding it up to play games but it works fairly well. There is not many apps available yet in the virtual reality category but I am sure there will be more to come. The ones I did find were great and realistic and fun to play. Spent some great time with this and know it will come in handy and be useful for many fun apps that eventually will be coming.,Positive,2,2

"On the whole these are pretty good headphones. Here's what I've found to be the Pros and Cons.<br />Pros:<br />- They are solidly built and easily adjustable to fit your head comfortably.<br />- The ear pads are ok and will probably soften a bit after I use them for a while.<br />- They come with a dual male 3.5mm jack cord. The cord itself is encased in a kind of woven material instead of the usual<br />  black plastic so it feels like it's sturdier and will last longer. Also, one male end is straight and the other has a 90<br />  degree jack. This may come in handy depending on what you're plugging into as you can reverse the cord from the device<br />  to the headphones if you need to.<br />- Sound is pretty good. I'm not audiophile but I found the highs, mids, and lows to be well balanced.<br />- It has an inline mic.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The cord is pretty short, about 3 feet, so this can be pretty restrictive if you're connected to something stationary like<br />  a PC.<br />- Passive sound suppression is not too good. I've been using these at work and they don't shut out the ambient sound as well as<br />  I'd like.<br />- Length of wear is an issue right now. They're a little tight right now and I can only go about 1/2 hour before I have to take<br />  them off for a while. This will likely improve over time as they get broken in.<br /><br />Overall these are a good deal if you want some decent quality at a reasonable price.",Positive,1,2

"Bluetooth function very finicky. Paired okay initially but when I went to use it the second time it would not connect, even though the Windows 10 bluetooth management console said it was connected. After experimenting for quite awhile I discovered that the key to getting this thing to reliably connect via bluetooth after initial pairing was to: 1. Make sure the Creative Labs device is turned off to begin with, 2. Make sure the bluetooth function is also toggled off in the Windows bluetooth management console, 3. Switch on the power to the Creative Labs device, 4. Then toggle on bluetooth function in the Windows bluetooth management console. It should find the device and connect to it now. 5. Toggle off the bluetooth function in the Windows management console before trying to reconnect with the device the next time.  Sound quality is &#34;meh&#34;.

"We recently dropped our cable service (because of constantly escalating and un-affordable prices), and were looking to go the route of streaming programming (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) supplemented with local HDTV broadcasts via an HDTV antenna hooked up to our 2 TVs.<br />We started with an amplified indoor antenna, but that did not work as we had expected, and were only able to get two or three main network channels at any time (after MANY attempts of moving all it over the room at various heights and placements). That it did not work as hoped was probably not for any lack of design or capability - we assume it had more to do with the area in which we live (Burbank, CA), which, according to our research, is a known dead-zone for broadcast signals.<br />Figuring then that we would need a more powerful rooftop-mounted antenna strong enough to get all of the main local HD channels we wanted, research into outdoor antennas brought us to the Antennas Direct Clearstream 2-V Long Range antenna, which after having been mounted in what was an optimum position (facing the mountain from which most of the signals are beamed) on our roof, after a channel scan, every single major network channel (plus about 60 more that we will never watch) came in crystal clear, and even better than they did via cable.<br />Love the antenna - is compact, easy to put together, and looks easy to mount. I say that because I hired a professional to install our antenna because I wanted them to use the pre-existing coax cable that was already wired (from a previous cable provider) in and under house, which required some professional know-how to connect to the new antenna.<br />We are very happy with the antenna - works just as advertised, even in our area, which is known for bad signal reception.",Positive,2,2

Very easy speaker set up, and if you get it wrong the first time, just run the setup again.  It's quick and easy.  I will warn you to look at the report when you are finished setting up.  My first attempt showed one speaker at 8 feet and the other at 16 feet, which was impossible since the speakers are almost identically placed from the listening position.  Running the setup again got it correct.  Again, if you don't go through the whole manual, you are going to miss out on some excellent features that allow you to easily set the listening mode that you want, i.e., the Net, DVD, TV, etc.",Positive,2,2

"For the past five years or so I've used Bose earbuds, but after another pair ripping in the same spot and becoming unusable, I decided it's time to do some research and find a different pair of earbuds, hopefully cheaper than my former Bose pairs. I spent hours and hours reading lists of 'best earbuds' I found on the web and reading reviews here on Amazon. I finally decided to try these out as a pretty inexpensive headphone to use for daily listening and to wear at the gym. My first impression is that they were a little difficult to 'get in.' Twisting them forward the right angle, and adjusting the memory wire behind the ears, I had to look in the mirror to get them in the right spot. These are more difficult to take in and out than other pairs I've had, so I wouldn't recommend them if you need to pop them in and out frequently. The memory wire behind the ear also becomes uncomfortable after a short length of time. I haven't even been able to stand wearing these earbuds for the entire length of my workouts. I take them out halfway through because they start to hurt and the transfer noise I'll mention next gets really annoying. The noise from the cords brushing against something (microphonics I think it's called from the review I read?) is unbearable with these headphones. When I was researching before my purchase, I read reviews that mentioned this issue, but I hadn't really understood what they were referring to as I never had this problem with my Bose earbuds. The cords of these earbuds are pretty stiff and seem like they would be tangle free but they always get tangled in my gym bag. I can't really attest to the sound of these because I've listened to talk radio with them and couldn't stand to wear them longer than that! Haven't even tried them with music.

To find myself saying that about a product I first became acquainted with in the 80s is really sad, but fact is, they were never made extremely well back then, and now they may as well be painted cardboard which has been specifically proprietized to make expanding them intentionally difficult.<br /><br />Buy yourself a nice 4 or even 5 inch wide black 3 ring binder, and fill it with black 3 ring pages as much as you want, and maybe you can find a zippered bag you can put the whole thing in so the discs don't toss out at the top.<br /><br />This thing requires too much fiddling just to get the proprietary binding straps to even come out of their slits. Since the straps only come loose from the left hand side, you are left with quite a mess anytime you decide to rearrange your media in this book.<br /><br />Standard 3 ring binders let you quickly flip to the exact area you want to add a page to, and add a page or pages.

"Yes the instruction are useless but I still give this device 4 stars because it's very functional if you have patience.  First, it took about 15 minutes to transfer and download my 2500 plus songs music from my computer to this device, just a matter of clicking and dragging from your music drive to the i drive.  Secondly, the device come with default settings that you'll have to navigate to get continuous play from your downloaded songs (why you need patience) to figure out. I don't use the other functions like the Photos and E-Book as my main reason for the purchase was the radio and the ability to download my songs which works great in my opinion.  I use mine when I run and at the health club so I didn't need something expensive. I haven't tried the headphones but I can only assume their not good but the battery life is admirable.  Overall if you have the tolerance, persistence and a small amount of literacy to play with the functions then you will have a decent MP3 player.  I got 4 years out of my cheap Coby player and I expect this one will last just as long.",Positive,1,2

"The product workmanship and sound quality are worth 5 stars.  I deducted one star for the following two reasons: 1) The On/Off switch is on the back of one of the speakers.  This is a strange choice since the speakers are usually mounted too high for this switch to be useful.  I used a switched outlet to solve this limitation. 2) The speakers make a very loud beep when turned ON and when connecting to bluetooth.  The volume of these beeps cannot be adjusted. Despite of these minor limitations, I would undoubtedly buy these speakers again. I actually found the bright blue LED that others criticized a nice feature because it is a reminder when the speakers are powered.",Positive,2,2
"I knew it didn't have a light when I purchased it.  However, it would be even better and would get 5 stars if it had a light since it is an under the cabinet kitchen CD/radio.

Ordered the just receiver item, (square receiver head), (Monoprice 5-Feet IR Extender Cable Receiver (108060)) on a whim and connected it to the setup, worked flawlessly, no issues.

Not a bad product but a little flimsy on the steel mounting bracket. This bracket also does not fit a Samsung 32&#34; UN32J5500AFXZA. I had to cut the brackets with a band saw so they wouldn't stick up above the TV. The price was cheap so its not a deal breaker for me.,Neutral,1,1
"Very low quality player. The volume defaults at 20 every time you turn on the unit even though a comfortable listening volume is around 2 or 3. This could be acceptable if you could start ramping down the volume while the motor started up but that's not the case; for the first couple seconds the unit will not register any volume change and then playback starts immediately.<br /><br />Even if you could live with that, the sound quality is very bad.

"Either these or the Bose Quiet Comfort. I've tried both and went with these and I am very happy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- The build quality far exceeds the Bose Quiet Comforts, those are made of cheap plastic and its a crying shame.<br />- Sound quality is extremely smooth, crisp but not sharp, very well balanced.<br />- Extremely comfortable, comes with additional replacement ear-muff pads.<br />- They fold, that's just nice. Some do not, and i do like the option to tuck these in a drawer easier.<br />- The Active Noise Cancellation works extremely, extremely well. If the Bose Quiet Comfort was 9/10, these would be 8/10, a subtle difference you may not notice.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Long use can hurt my ear cartilage, I do have very large ears though -- satellite sized ears, it's really my problem more than the product.<br />- The piece holding the batteries for the Noise Cancellation does not &#34;snap in&#34; with a nice click Id like to hear, meaning you could accidentally lift them up if you did it in the right way.<br />- The piece on the other side that is identical to the battery side is also removable, it's nice, but I have no idea what that is for an found it strange.",Positive,2,2

"I purchased a set of these some time ago and was given a second set to review. Both are fantastic products. The sound is loud enough to hear from another floor and activates from a reasonable distance. My two concerns are that I am unable to tell when I need to replace the battery, and that one remote can work for both sets of key finders. The latter issue also can have advantages (assuming your remote breaks) but I can also see it as a problem if you're looking for your keys and someone else also happens to have the same color keyring.

"We used this TV to mount a 55 inch LED TV. Before mounting your TV I recommend looking once for the guidelines for how high to mount your TV for comfortable viewing.<br />The mount itself is built of sturdy metal, painted black. It is quite heavy. The mount works great but the instructions were not the best. My husband figured it out easily enough but did complain about the instructions.<br />Mounting a large TV is a two person job for some steps. The most difficult part was getting the TV on the mount securely and that is because my husband was screwing the screws in and I was trying to hold the huge TV up. The mount swivels and can get pushed back or pulled out to be closer or farther from the wall. It also tilts up and down some. The moving parts of this mount are very, very stiff. They do move, but it takes some real working of the joints to get them where you want them. Once you get them set you do not have to worry about them moving or slipping. There is also an area on the back to run your cables through to help organize them.<br /><br />I recieved a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",Positive,2,2

The position of the over-ear piece (I'm sure this has a name but I don't know it) is somewhat flexible, which provides a comfortable fit, and that this same piece folds down flat makes the headphones pack nicely.The padding is just right, and while these aren't noise-canceling, they do keep most extraneous noise out, even with music, etc., played at low-moderate volume.",Positive,2,2

The headphones are for my daughter for school.  We looked over many different headphones on Amazon with different styles/colors and she came across the design of your headphone and she completely fell in love.  She is in 5th grade and will be using the headphones on a daily basis as her school utilizes iPad's in their classrooms.<br /><br />The headphones are very portable because they fold up and can be<br />stored very easily when she is not using.  The price was very competitive to other similar models that we looked and so far we haven't had any issues with them so feel they are definitely a good value.<br /><br />The headphones came in a small box that was shipped in a larger box with packing to ensure they arrived in perfect condition (which they did).  Based on our initial impression of the<br />headphones we would purchase it again depending how long they actually stand up in a school environment.,Positive,2,2

"SHARKK Bluetooth Speaker Mini Portable Red.  Bought this for just under 40 dollars.  I was sure that it was not from China as there are lots of mini portable light speakers out there that are only worth their weight in gold...and the others are worth 5 dollars selling for ten to twenty dollars.  This speaker is mini but has a great weight and sturdiness to it.  It feels it's complete price which I got at 37.99.  I connected vie Bluetooth but was waiting for my MicroSD card so I could play a game on my phone.  Clear solid Bass sound.  Good volume, it was clear throughout the house and I went outside and heard it clearly through an open window.  When I did buy a microsd I tried it but it didn't work.  I wrote and then called.  Customer service said the card should play immediately and it must be a malfunction.  He sent one out right away with a full paid am return shipping.  Awesome customer service.  Glad I'm trustworthy and that they were just as trustworthy.  New one.  No problems.  I love the size.  The sound is beautiful with clear bass and clear lyrics.  Other companies may sell the cheaper ones which I've tried and the weight causes a twang in the music.  They are just too light and not solidly made.

"SW-22050 Review<br /><br />First I'd like to start by saying I ordered this believing that it had a S-Video output since that is stated in the product information/description a couple times [b]&#34;Output VGA\ VIDEO\ S-VIDEO signal at the same resolution&#34;[/b] and [b]&#34;this converter also comes with an S-Video cable if you prefer that port&#34;[/b]. Though I blame myself for not looking more carefully at the pictures I was disappointed when the product came and I saw that it had no S-Video output.  I've also just noticed that the reviews for the SW-22050 and the SW-23000 share the same reviews page so maybe the sellers put the wrong item description for the SW-22050 or maybe there's something I'm not getting?<br /><br />But since I have the SW-22050 already and I was more than impressed with it, I decided to keep it and forget about the S-Video that comes with the SW-23000. I also don't want to deal with refunding and waiting for another one to be shipped to me. I am using it on my Sony KV-27FV300 Trinitron and I was impressed by the output. Text was not legible at high resolutions but after changing some font settings on my PC and the resolution to 800x600, reading text was not a problem.  Though I'm not using this for reading but strictly for watching movies, so being able to read text isn't very important to me. My one issue with the product is this buzzing noise that comes out of my TV's speakers when I use the composite (red/white) audio cables. I managed to reduce the buzzing after changing certain audio settings on my TV such as reducing bass,treble,WOW, BBE.  So it's not a major issue but annoying enough to not want to hear it while watching movies.  Though I have to say the video quality is excellent and much better than I had expected, I'd say even better than my LG LCD monitor. I would give the SW-22050 4/5 stars, not 5 stars because of the buzzing noise that comes out of my TV.<br /><br />I was going to get a refund and order the Sewell Direct SW-23000 instead just because I prefer S-Video, which I thought was included with the SW-22050. But since I was more than satisfied with the SW-22050 I decided to keep it.",Positive,2,2

"Cable looks, works, and functions great.  It's a little stiff though.  I knew going in that it would be more stiff being braided cables, but it is quite a bit more stiff than I anticipated, which is mainly an issue behind the TV where I want to make a couple bends to keep the wire hidden.  I will eventually put HDMI through my walls and just use this as a spare long cable as needed for connecting a laptop, setting a TV outside, and other temporary uses.<br /><br />UPDATE - I increased my review from 4 to 5 stars because really the cables are great and very rugged, which is why they may not be as flexible as other cables.  Also after leaving a nice professional review I was contacted by the company to thank me for the review and I really like to see a company go that extra mile and listen to the feedback they are getting.

The good news is, blowing fuses is easy to troubleshoot, so there's no doubt the unit is faulty.<br /><br />I believe in 2nd chances, so 2 stars for now. I have a replacement coming. Hopefully this was a fluke, but either way I'll update the review after it arrives.",Positive,2,2

"All I can say is wow! This is the first wall T.V. mount that I have purchased, I was always a little hesitant on purchasing one as I have heard horror stories on installations. This was by far the easiest project I have done, I was able to hang the T.V. and wire manage all the cabling in about an hour. I used this mount for a Samsung 4K 40 inch T.V. and it looks glorious in it's natural habitat on the wall. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a new wall mount. Keep this in mind, there are only 6 easy steps in installing this, however I would highly recommend to be patient towards the end, the end being adjusting the tension of the arm. The instructions are a little vague in this process, I would recommend navigating to this YouTube video. This video explains in detail on where to adjust the multiple points of tension, the video is produced by OmniMount. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWutYJKUQ88",Positive,2,2

"Frustrating but.I have been searching high and low for a 12-outlet surge protector with a high joule rating (over 1,500 V), but more imortantly, a clamping voltage of 330V. Since Amazon did not list the clamping voltage for this particular item (BE112234-10), I called Belkin, and they assured me that the clamping voltage for Model BE112234-10 is 330V. Terrific. I then saw some other posts for this item on Amazon, including a photograph of the item's box (posted by George Varghese) which clearly indicated that the clamping voltage (shown on the side of the box) is 500V (too high to protect my sensitive equipment). However, another post, by Marmalade, stated that he was reading right off of HIS box for Model BE112234-10, and it DID show a clamping voltage of 330V. When I did receive the product from Amazon, however, it sadly showed a clamping voltage of 500V, both on the box (which has all of the same specs as is shown in Mr. Varghese's photo - I posted a photo of my own that looks...

"Great sturdy stand. Nice look. I'm using it with Klipsch RB-51 II Reference Series Bookshelf speakers. Looks great!<br /><br />My only complaint is out of the box it isn't perfect.<br /><br />1) I ended up buying &#34;Blu-Tack Reusable Adhesive&#34; to sit the speaker with the stand. It works really well, absorbs sound vibration between speaker and the metal stand it sits on. It sticks very decently without residue, where if it lean the stand with the speaker (by a reasonable amount), the speaker won't fall off.<br /><br />2) The stand does not work well on hard wood floor. It comes with gigantic ground spikes I presume work well with carpet, but there's no way you can use this on hard wood floors. I ended up buying 3M rubber sticking pads, 4 for each stand.<br /><br />All in all, I would buy again.",Positive,2,2

It's really freaking bright.  I set mine on the lowest dimmer setting but it resets itself to level 1 everyday no matter what.  I added a dimming sheet to the front but it's still too bright for me.

"I get 65 channels via this antenna.  I do not get ABC channel though and some channels are blank or saying weak signals though.  We don't watch much TV except for netflix or Amazon instant video so as long as we get Univision, PBS, CBS, and Fox channels, we are,ok with it.  My area has hills and the towers are more than 15 miles from my house that makes it hard for us to get good signals.  I put this antenna indoor behind the window.  This amplified antenna definitely get better signal than the non-amplified flat/thin antenna I was using.  Considering the performance and the price, I will give it 3 stars.  Other similar 60 mile range antennas cost around that price range and I think they are all over priced considering how much it probably cost the companies to make them.  Same for other non amplified flat/thin antennas that cost more than 30 dollars which I am sure it only cost them less than a dollar to make each one of them.  Good profits for those companies.",Neutral,2,1

"I've bought quite a few of these and they are built fairly well for the price.  The slim plug works well to get into a cell phone case hole where a full-size plug is too big.

I expected the mic conductor at least to be shielded, but I've cut several open for projects and it isn't.",Positive,2,2
"Researched all similar options for a small bluetooth speaker and finally decided on this one. I couldn't find another one that had all the features this one does: volume control, track forward/back, micro SD card ability, microphone, auxiliary jack and cable, wall plug and USB cable for charging, appealing design. Speaker definitely has great full sound for its size. Impressive. The cables it comes with are shorter than I'd like, but I have much longer cables I can use instead (or you could easily buy another longer cable for very little money) so that's not a big deal to me. The biggest issue I ran into is that the speaker will not play when fully charged and still plugged in. It will play when plugged in while it's still charging, but once fully charged, nothing. I'm forced to unplug it at that point to be able to use it (hence I docked a star on the rating). Which stinks because ideally I just wanted to keep this little speaker always plugged in so I didn't have to think about when it needed to be charged. Maybe the one I got is defective in that regard, I don't know. I may try ordering another one and see if that one works the same way, but I suspect it will. I love this little speaker otherwise so that particular drawback is a bummer.",Positive,2,2

"Some say the controls are &#34;not intuitive.&#34; That doesn't do it justice. They are nonsensical. It works, and it's inexpensive, but it's awkward to use. There is no way to organize your material, say, to search by album or artist. When you click on &#34;Music&#34; it takes you to last-used track. You may then click through your tracks alphabetically, or click down to a folder tree to find your desired track. So you are maybe four clicks in before you can start looking for what you want. You'll need to manually create folder for albums, or else all albums and artists will be shuffled together alphabetically. Call me old fashioned, but I believe the designers of any product should give a minimum of thought to how it will be used.  * To begin, the labels are printed in fuzzy silver on white, so if you are at all nearsighted, forget it. But this isn't so bad, since the labels have nothing to do with what the buttons do. * To move up or down through menus, you click left or right. * To play or pause music, you push down (play) * To back up to the previous menu, you push down (play), unless you're at a music track, when you push up (menu) * To select a menu item, you push up (menu) * To adjust volume you first push center (select), then press left or right  UPDATE: I've discovered further drawbacks, and docked a star: * Most of the display is taken up with an EQ animation, leaving little room for track, album, and artist information. I'm listening to an audiobook, &#34;The Queen of the Tearling,&#34; which displays as &#34;The Queen of the.&#34; * Fast-forward and Rewind are at a fixed, rather slow rate. It takes a long time to advance 5 minutes, and if you have a one hour audio file, and you need to find your place 45 minutes in, you would probably have to hold &#34;Fast&#34; Forward for about nine minutes. It will only hold your place if you don't change what you're listening to.  In other words, it's USELESS for audiobooks.",Negative,1,0

The only con I can think of so far is regarding the speaker wires that came with it. Unless you have a super tiny apartment, then the cable provided isn't going to be even remotely enough length. Also, the wires itself seems of low quality than any other speaker wires independently sold at best buy or on amazon.

With more power, the speakers can be pushed more and therefore the speakers are louder and sound much clearer. Bass is pushed some but still needs a bit better tuning. The JBL's are very good when run directly with a high powered receiver, but with my set up, it is not possible. It is in a closet, so the extremely loud cooling fan noise is not heard while playing. If you had to have this in the same room as your speakers, I probably would return it just on the fan noise alone. With that said, for my set up, it is well worth the money.

The designers of this product have found a way to keep cords from falling back behind your desk in such a tasteful and modern way that dosnt end up looking tacky like some other cord management devices.  For non magnetic devices it comes with silicon clips with metal built into the end to allow it to work with the base.  The bottom of the base has the reusable sticky substance that keeps it from sliding on your desk but is easily removed.  If you want a more permanent solution it comes also with a round 3m tape to secure it but it is really not necessary.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and true review but I found this product so good i am purchasing another one in aluminum at retail price to keep on my nightstand for my phone cord as well.,Positive,1,2

I bought this 4 pack of batteries to use with my new battery charger.  They charge up quickly and to a full charge.  I highly recommend these batteries.,Positive,2,2
worked like a charm with my five year old TV,Positive,2,2
"Good fit, good sound, overall good quality",Positive,2,2
"These headphones were a great deal, and good sound for the price, however they broke within the first month of use. First the left headphone stopped, and shortly thereafter the right broke. Loved them until that moment though.",Negative,0,0
"Looks nice, works well. Arrived quickly. Had an extra bounus part.",Positive,1,2
"Works great with RTL-SDR software. This has the correct chips. I used this with Chrome &#34;Radio Receiver&#34; (Yes, SDR within Chrome browser!) and a few other SDR applications for Mac OSX. The supplied antenna is not well matched for lower frequency bands, so be sure to pick up an adapter coax and a real antenna. It is more suitable for 1 GHz+. I could barely get the local VHF WX station on it. But this is a physics problem, not a product problem.<br /><br />Does get hot, probably causes the frequency to drift, but so far nothing really has come of this. Seems to tune down to about 25MHz before it craps out, with terrible sensitivity. A little lower than I expected. I have a Ham It Up on order for lower frequencies anyway.",Positive,2,2
Its wonderful,Positive,2,2
Works as needed.,Positive,2,2
"I bought these at walmart. I really liked the ability to remotely turn things on/off and have different remotes with different strips in the same room with different frequencies (A, B, and C) .  BUT they are single surge thunderstorm  blown and then bricked. none of my other surge protectors (higher protection standards) blew, but two of these did. I will not buy these again. too many power outages and one outage blew a third.  NOT ecological when they go to the land fill because no replaceable fuse!!!!!!",Neutral,2,1
I also added a 25ft extension and it still worked,Positive,2,2
This is  a good choice if all you need is a power strip. The price is right and it functions as expected. If you are not looking for surge protection this is the one for you.,Positive,2,2
Love it,Positive,2,2

"I live in the UK where this amplifier comes from . I have been using the Caspian Series M2 Integrated amplifier, initially as a stop gap measure until I could afford to have my high end system overhauled . That was three years ago. I am still using it with the Caspian cd player used in a balanced mode and a pair of Triangle Signature Delta speakers and I feel no urgent need whatsoever to have my Naim amps and Mark Levinson cd player overhauled. Why ? May you ask . Simply because the sound I am getting is as good as my so called high end super expensive system!<br />The Roksan amp is so good that it will make you think it's an amp costing several thousands $ more. The soundstage it produces is as good as my Naim 250s and 135s. It will drive difficult loads without any problem but more importantly, it can be happily partnered with a wide range of speakers. The funny thing is that the cables I am using cost more than the amp and cd player combined! You would think that the Kimber bifocal XL speaker cables would show up the Caspian M2 shortcomings. Well, they don't. As a matter of fact, the combination seems to be a perfect match with the internal Kimber wiring of the French speakers being used as well. The conservative 85 watts power per channel quoted by the maufacturer do not necessarily reflect on the loudness level this amp can subjectively produce. You can have Lady Gaga full blast at high levels if you wish and if you are prepared for a lawsuit with your neighbours. Your speakers might go first, and your wife next but not the amp which I believe has a very sophisticated protection circuit, unllike the Naims of earlier years.<br />What makes this amp so special is its versatility and ability to reproduce any music regardless of the genre. Whether you listen to Grace Jones, Count Basie or WA Mozart, it will invariably communicate the message and emotions contained in the music. The preamp section is so good that you can play older recordings without having to worryabout the potentially obstrusive background noise. Alfred Cortot playing Schumann Carnaval recorded in 1928 sounds amazingly fresh and exciting and Maria Callas singing  Abigail in that impossible Verdi aria from Nabucco is simply out of this world. Mind you, using the Kimber Kable all round helps as well.<br />I hope that by now I have convinced you  about makes this British amplifier so special. By the way, it is the top recommended amplifier in the UK What Hi Fi magazine for amps costing £ 1500 and above. So, even if you buy it in the US, it will not cost you that much more at $ 3000 a piece. It retails for £ 2000 in the UK.<br />I think anyone looking for a top performer at an affordable price should put this amplifier on their list for auditioning. I wonder if any dealer would dare use it with a pair of Wilson Audio speakers ! That would be an interesting alternative to the overpriced Naim Statement !<br />So, to sum up my review, the Caspian M2 series 2 amplifier is probably the best kept secret in the hifi world .<br />PS:  I  am not a member of the British Audio Indusrty trying to promote British equipment ! I am simply an ordinary guy who takes a genuine interest in high quality hifi products at a realistic price.",Positive,2,2
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.,Positive,2,2
"Fried my ps3. Honestly, I had no idea it would. The older models use a power cord that is very similar to a pc power cord",Negative,2,0
"I looked at the reviews before buying and was a little hesitant with some of the negative reviews. They were a good price and had the BOSE name so I decided to try them out.<br />The sound is really good for my interests. They do sound much better then my cheap pair on ear and so much better then my in ear Seinheiser.<br />I haven't experienced any &#34;leakage&#34; that other reviewers have. There is some with the volume turned all the way up and the headphones sitting on my desk, but I don't listen with the volume turned that far up - I value my hearing.<br />They are comfortable to wear, the ear pieces are very comfortable for me and they are light weight.<br /><br />The bad part: The cable is crap. Utter crap. I ordered these and the sound didn't work on one side so I wiggled the cable near the jack that goes into the computer and the sound worked on both sides. Wiggle it again and the sound goes out. The replacement cable is way to expensive for replacing so I returned the pair and got a new pair.  These work better and I'll be reinforcing the cable.<br /><br />Over all. Well. I can't believe BOSE would bring such a dysfunctional piece of equipment to market like this. But reinforcing the cable will work and for the price it's ok. For those people using these very frequently I would recommend spending the extra money on something else. For those like me that use them at work they will be just fine.",Neutral,1,1
This cable stopped working after couple of months.,Negative,0,0
"These earbuds for the iPhone or iPad do not sound any better than the original Apple ear buds.  They come with three sizes of ear bud adapters however even the smallest size was too big for my (largish) ears and were uncomfortable to wear.  The volume adjustment switch behaves oddly.<br /><br />I did like the built-in magnets that cause the ear buds to stay together when not in use.  That's a clever and useful touch.  But overall, these are not  in any way better than the original ear buds.",Negative,1,0
Nice cables with a firm connection.,Positive,2,2
Great little speaker.,Positive,2,2
"These were my first $20ish pair of earbuds, so I hoped my extensive research on Amazon would bear fruit, and it definitely did. I listen to everything from electronic and dubstep to orchestral music, rock and rap, and it all sounds...just better. Warmer. Skullcandy earbuds sound tinny compared to these. I can hear a lot more things in the background, including stuff I never picked up before, and if you want some really full, palpable bass, these more than do the job. Between these and the EQs on my Rockboxed Mp3 player I'm a pretty happy camper.",Positive,2,2
"Just what I needed, but the cord as too long.",Positive,1,2

"Great price, did what it was supposed to do",Positive,2,2
Arrived on time and exactly what I was looking for.,Positive,2,2
A very good extension for various computer add ons. Really good for those that have the large transformer type plugs that often overlap other  plug in items  that won't fit side by side on ordinary strips. The longer cord gives you more length if your wall plug and the items you are attaching to it need to be close enough to reach. Price right too.,Positive,2,2
"This is an excellent product... There is no way you can come out with a crooked TV, follow the instructions and you will not be disappointed.",Positive,2,2
Broke quickly,Negative,0,0
"These were delivered very quickly! I've had it for a few weeks now & I have to say it is very simple to use. The instructions were clear as to how to sync the Bluetooth. The audio is clear & it the earphones are comfortable. I feel like they could fit a little better, but I haven't tried the other attachments yet, so that might be my problem. Overall, I'm very happy at how well this set of headphones perform.",Positive,2,2

"Best price on this battery pack by far!!  50% less expensive than any other retailer, online or in store.  Installed them in my sister's scooter, and off she went.  The smile on her face was priceless , making this purchase an incredible value.  If you have or know someone with, mobility issues due to age, health, loss of limb(s) or whatever reason, get them a new battery. See the difference it makes for them.  Something as simple as a battery goes a long way.",Positive,2,2

Very nice product ... easy to setup and no problem what so ever. I would recommend to any who need to setup a second monitor or  want to send to other tv monitor. I have a google tv 40in. and wanted to use it as a monitor so it was clear the way to go was this splitter. Low cost oh ya.. get one.,Positive,2,2

"Nicely made, promptly shipped. I use this at the end of a piece of (stiff) LMR-400 coax. It's very flexible, so it goes into the back of my transceiver much easier than the LMR-400 does.<br />I do wish that they made this same cable with LMR-240, though. For UHF, even 5 feet of RG-58 costs you some signal.<br />I've ordered several cables from MPD, and I've always been very happy with the purchase.",Positive,2,2

"Hifiplus reported that Andrew Jones used a pair of generic speaker stands at T.H.E. Show Newport ELAC showroom, &#34;For the demonstration, the speakers were shown on generic albeit sand-filled stands priced at $50/pair ...&#34;. Elsewhere, digitalaudioreview wrote &#34;The entire system on show had reportedly arrived at the Hotel Irvine in two suitcases, including speaker stands sourced from Amazon.com for US$49.&#34; If I'm not mistaken, these stands are the same stands pictured in the photo.<br /><br />I would have never thought tempered glass was a good medium for speaker vibrations even if the post was filled with sand. Apparently I need to re-examine my preconceptions about speaker stand materials and the value of these stands. To me, certainly any of the neg reviews here now come off as quibbling, nit-picky and thankless if rock star speaker designer Andrew Jones was able to leverage these in conjunction with the forthcoming ELAC Debut B5 to produce sound that left listeners in gob smacking awe...",Positive,2,2

"In using this product with an iWatch, it sounded great when I first sync'd (paired) the headphones, but as I went outside on a run, the headphones constantly shorted out.  The sound was spotty, even if I held the device right up to the headphones.  It was so bad that I couldn't even maintain pace with a song beat, because I would only receive garbled and broken content through the headphones.  I bought these because the reviews from so many people were great, however...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!",Negative,1,0

"Bought this even though we live about 50 miles from towers. I put this in my upstairs closet where the home run wiring system is housed. Signal is split into 3 TVs using standard 3 way splitter.
